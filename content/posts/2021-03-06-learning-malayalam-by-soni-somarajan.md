**Learning Malayalam**  
_Manjadithara, Puthupally, 1982_

**അ**  
On the layer of sand  
that my forefinger parts, the curvaceous overture  
begins to reveal an elephant in a  
line drawing.

I taste succulent jungle grass.

Say, if I held the shell  
of the first alphabet close to my ear,  
would it be

a tribute to the mammal’s memory—  
something I need  
to embark on a journey of language?

**ഋ**  
In innocence, I saw only  
the deer’s horns, doe eyes, and the tense lines,  
ready to spring and sprint away.

But there is this recurring dream  
of a half-roar. Many years later, I would  
sense the cat in me.

The cat remains asleep—  
just as the world desires: be good, nice,  
even if it means to live a lie.

The wilderness yearns to break free,  
the goodness, at times, way too nice.  
Is there room for a docile roar—

I wonder.

**ക**  
The steam train muscles through the Coromandel coast,  
leaving plumes of soot and vapour. An egg-seller  
walks past, balancing boiled eggs, freshly

ground pepper and chilli powder. Pukish,  
the nine-year-old looks away, hoping his sleeping  
parents won’t hear the seller.

Then in his reverie, the war comic slides lazily  
down to the lurching floor. The battle in  
_Commando No.2915: King Tiger_,

moves to a barren, smoking grassland. A turret  
sweeps into view over a rugged hump. In its  
crosshairs—the exposed rear of an Allied tank.

**ഛ**  
This shell-shaped translucence  
leaving a silvery trail, the story we carry.

This feast of green, spurning gravity,  
the acrobatic tremble heedless of danger.

Do we not see the jealousy of the vine:  
growth quashed by the slowest of living?

Out of nowhere, a startling insight,  
a hummingbird, its beak painted in sunlight.

What remains in this sanctum  
of the present: an ooze of leftover memory,

the fractured whorls of a mollusc.

**ജ**  
Under the heavy jack tree,  
a paleness in the earth, an unmarked remembrance.

Grandfather, look within me  
from your sanctum in the perspiring sod. You see

I am a hundred versions of myself:  
monks in prayer—remembering you, bowing like

a rain-hit lotus.

**യ**  
Bathed in this light, I think of the many ways  
it plays us.

In these deep woods, choosing  
many forms: flitting as a butterfly, darting like a stag,  
crawling on all fours, climbing high branches,

reflecting like a sage, angling as a tree’s roots,  
pulsing like veins, swinging like a dancer.  
If I cracked open, you would see light there too.

If this light be in us, why do we keep returning  
to why we can&#8217;t see each other?

**ൺ**  
The caterpillar,  
a ho-hum line of rowing paddles, an armada’s progress.

No, a steam whistle that marks the genie&#8217;s escape,  
a pugnacious spurt of coal smoke.

Sunlight’s a speeding train, a coruscating line of beads,  
such a turn of phrase at the tunnel’s end.

Watch from afar this fleeting disembodiment,  
clap for the stunning overture of speed.

Remove oneself the farthest, to the landscape of  
questions, gain the hermit’s advantage.

What if one kept one’s ears to the rails:  
would we hear a summer’s day, its slow minutes

clanging in the distance, or would we count  
the days left to reach home?
