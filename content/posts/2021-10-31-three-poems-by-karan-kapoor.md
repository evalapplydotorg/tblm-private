**Saffron**

An avid reader of the Punjab Kesari, my father  
uses the toilet longer than any man.

Forgetting how these conversations always end,  
I express my repugnance over a mob lynching.

_If they know beef hurts our  
sentiments_, he asks me, _why eat it?_

On the screen, a pack of gray wolves  
hungry for days, hound a reindeer.

I tell him lynchings are unjust  
even if someone eats a cow solely to offend.

How can you ever compare human life  
with a cow&#8217;s?

The music in the room rises to a crescendo  
falls to the sound of teeth against neck.

Deer in the jaw of a wolf — the pack slows,  
the death of their hunger close.

_A hundred and one Muslims can be sacrificed  
for a single hair of a cow._

The Nat Geo narrator calls it the circle of life.  
My father calls it survival.

**My Helpless Ode**

My father asks me to write  
a perfect poem, one with no moon.  
All moon-poems are clichés,  
he says, plus it makes me think  
of Muslims and you know how  
I feel about them. So if there is  
even half a moon in your poem,  
I&#8217;ll drink tonight. I chip the moon  
from my perfect poem and look  
for other things. I try to add  
oranges, honeybees, a fire licking  
a lake of knives, a woman who  
is smoke if you look closely, a pig  
which is not really a pig but a man  
with a dead dog in his arms,  
a laughing light, a pink clock  
with Shaolin swords as its arms,  
Sisyphus&#8217; boulder rolling down,  
winged apples, walking pens,  
a yawning book — I stash  
these images in the refrigerator,  
and when my father asks me  
to serve him a perfect poem, I offer  
him a Black Dog. He&#8217;s so dazzled  
that instead of saying your poem  
couldn&#8217;t have been more perfect,  
if there is a thing such as that,  
he forgets his promise and swigs  
the whisky neat, wipes his lips  
into a grin. I cry green  
tears and dream of carrying  
a crescent moon on my head  
for the rest of the night.

**Nine Reasons to Write a Ghazal in a Time of Fascism**

Draw on tongues of two worlds to light a ghazal.  
Hijack the fire of the sun, sing the night a ghazal.

You are a passenger of grief, your Stygian  
soul one noun alone ignites: a _ghazal_.

Some break a mosque, some build a temple.  
Some bite the bullet, I bite a ghazal.

Blackbird, parrot, nightingale, all need to sing.  
When we can compose, why fight a ghazal?

The world brims with bruises and paper.  
Curves of words spark respite—a ghazal!

Words elude us in weighted times.  
Give in to the want of calm, flight a ghazal.

They&#8217;ve changed names of cities, now erasing Nehru;  
write, write before they come to set alight a ghazal.

It is a body suited to joy and light. I want to pen—  
though, father, you look at me with spite—a ghazal.

_Karan, are you ashamed of being a Hindu?  
If not, then why should you write a ghazal?_
