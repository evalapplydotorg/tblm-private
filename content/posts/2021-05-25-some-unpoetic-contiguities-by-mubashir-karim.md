The tea cup has broken  
in the shape of your lip &#8211;  
the way people break  
when nudged by grief.

The ink has spilled near the pocket  
in the shape of a territory &#8211;  
the stain stays &#8211;  
the way an occupier does.

The paperback has dog eared  
around the edges –  
the way Time arrives  
as a wave.

The mirror has splintered  
into fragments &#8211;  
the way autumnal leaves crunch  
when stepped over.

The door has been smeared  
around the handle &#8211;  
the way dark circles encamp  
under the eyes.

The face has cultivated  
pimples overnight &#8211;  
the way poems arrive  
in the midst of a crowd &#8211;  
unrhymed.
