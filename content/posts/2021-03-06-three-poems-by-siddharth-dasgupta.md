**The Drunkard of Pattinson Rd.**

On the radio, something from the 1950s.  
You know immediately when something’s from  
the 1950s—the hesitancy of voice, the ire  
of age; the innocence, nothing more than  
a photograph wrapped in quatrain, left  
to the whims of verses dipped in fire.

In a city, its eyes the roar of minarets,  
I try and trace the passage of love. Lafz,  
spoken and swallowed by air or left behind  
in the moodiness of books. The words, broken,  
bitten and chewed and memorised to heart,  
these shy fragments of fractal perfection.

Ardour meanders like the waywardness  
of the weather—Gauhar Jaan’s soliloquys,  
exhumed, dipped in the nasha of aged Shiraz.  
Love is this land’s rich lineage, ink and mythos,  
blood, an autumnal empire of things being  
beautiful, if only to burn, and some day,  
in the lap of auroras, be born again.

I follow the trail of love into neighborhoods  
where stanzas line the streets—some the  
draped playfulness of Urdu, some the crisp  
decoration of Hindi, some the sweetened  
kiss of Bangla—dancing my way through  
rosewater fountains and gardens bisected in  
fours, my dreams by now bisected in halves.

A night, its veins ripped apart. A splinter  
of Khusrau, splitting the stillness of time.  
This land’s umbilical marks, its legacies  
opulently reaped; my inquest of love, now  
dowsed in the strange fruit of attar, lune,  
and the crescent of uninhabited things.

I carry the overture with me, a 1950s  
dream, holding a composition of desire  
and Ghalib’s wounded lunacies. I shall  
continue my search as long as the song  
continues to play. The hesitancy of voice;  
the ire of age. This heart bound to the  
mischief of air. _Dil-e-Nadan tujhe hua kya hai…_

**Should You Ever Leave the Aegean**

The seventh day of August is when  
the weather turns. I can hear it in  
the stillness, that temporary pause  
in the love affair, before the final  
departure of disco-pink tourists,  
and in time, the undressing.

In this foreign air, in the spasms  
of this foreign light, I taste Ghalib;  
in the screaming hedonism of his  
ghazal, in time, his kindred—Hafez.  
I rescue three birds of Sufi; soon,  
their promiscuous melodies will have  
torn hawthorn-shaped enigmas  
in the arrogance of the sky.

Laila is in her blue longing. I miss  
her already, all sherbet lips and songs  
of strange delights. In time, farewells  
brewed in the darkened charisma of  
unknown languages. The drenched  
telegrams of dreams written and  
posted, but never to arrive.

I bite into a poem, allow its tangy  
melodrama to fill my sclera. Lungful  
of an orphaned chrysalis. There will  
be a boat at seven, departing from  
the placenta of two ruined continents.  
All love is crumpled newspapers.  
A newspaper-boat, with a man  
stranded within it. This song will  
fathom the sea. In blue. In time.

**Desiderata, Times Two**

Lie, stir. After a while, our bodies are paintings—  
carefully composed limbs, a smidgeon of unexpected  
light. I lie on her lap, reading from Sylvia Plath.  
She speaks of broken things, of tissue and thirst,  
translucence, of days lashed with a silent gnawing,  
written into the silences of my lover’s book—its  
gathering of underlined lines and forgotten leaves.

I wish we could capture certain afternoons and  
store them in casks or drawers. Sure, we have  
memory, but it might still be worthwhile to have  
something whose _uncasking_ or _undrawing_ sends  
reverberations into the vulnerabilities of our skin  
—an arousal, in stanzas; the inflection of opera.  
The tenor, each measure, an errant surge in serif.

Shadows shift about in restlessness. Cadenza,  
ravenous for finale, where even touch feels like  
tremor, the torment of taste. Perfumed, her  
sighs, with the kissed transference of some more  
Sylvia Plath. I move the drapes and breathe  
in the sea—the lighthouse to the east, reminding  
me of home, of how almost everything lies east.

Impious lips; these afternoons of fermented olives  
and whispering candelabra, burn, breathlessly lit.  
As a boy, I thought you’d be safe, as long as you  
could get yourself to a lighthouse. We are the myths  
we swallow, its finely-seasoned inconsistencies.  
I lick her language and inhale her hair, hoping  
against hope, that I can get myself to a lighthouse.
