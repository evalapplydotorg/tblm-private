**Premonitions** 

1

A white room with monitors  
an otherworldly space in winter  
I see you from the flip side  
of the soundproof glass-wall;  
tubes inserted from every side  
screens playing an unscripted  
language in motion.  
Your body is immobile &#8211; but your  
eyes, they dart in all directions  
in their yearning to remember &#8211;  
our eyes meet for a moment,  
I read the question inscribed  
in your glance &#8211; what if death  
actually means forgetting to live?

2

You are motionless on your bed-  
I try to wake you up; but your  
eyes are wide open. I know  
that a coldness entered your  
body &#8211; like a town taken over  
by a curfew on a winter night.  
I still believe that you remember.  
How can you forget me, after all,  
and leave these spaces to emptiness?  
How can you negate the meaning  
of our everlasting togetherness?  
Maybe you are still sleeping  
with your eyes open (why not!)  
and dreaming into your memories,  
going backwards in time.

I see you in a train window; you  
are leaving this town. You see me  
without guilt. I don’t want to know  
where you are going.  
I only hope you have a ticket.

**How to Score in a Small-Town  
**  
You have to find an alley invisible  
to the rest. It will be the most overlooked  
one, in a bustling centre. There, you’ll  
find a half-blind old man in the saffrons,  
sitting on the steps of an abandoned  
government building. He will be drinking  
tea; sit next to him and try to strike  
a conversation. He is cranky, he will  
scare you away, he will cuss you for being  
a horrible human being, he will say the  
meanest things about your existence,  
and eventually, he will open up to you.  
He will tell you about the news he read  
in the morning paper and then  
about his family. How his middle-  
aged daughter and her ill-minded  
husband are plotting to kick him  
out of his home. His wife died of cancer  
a few years ago, in the government  
hospital. He says life is an end to itself,  
that there’s no hell or heaven and  
death is the only thing he is waiting for.  
That’s when you tell him why you came  
and show him the money you have,  
ask ‘oka potlam’. 

He will take it out and hand it over  
as you give him the crumbled notes, the  
only evidence of your identity, your life,  
in a town numbed with the high of reality.

**Her Name  
**  
_for Maruj  
_  
1

Her name is a curfew  
in the night of a country;  
It’s the letter that writes itself  
in the hurry of turning into ashes. 

2

I try to hold on to her name  
every time I say it; it melts  
away into the history of nouns;  
a flake of ice on tongue. 

3

There are so many things we  
don’t notice in our lives.  
‘For instance’, I ask her, ‘where  
did the nails you bit off  
in the morning disappear?’ 

4

Her silence is the gunshot  
fired at a distance.  
Her silence, the war ground  
many lovers died in the past. 

5

The words that fail reach her,  
they go astray in midair; They  
abandon meanings and become,  
winds in the night,  
chasing street dogs. 

6

“I am afraid of your absence”  
I say, loud enough for her to know  
what I mean. “Everyone goes  
missing in this country” she says.

7

In the end, there’s a finitude.  
She says ‘Take care’ before  
dissolving into silence. I say,  
‘You too’ to her ghost.
