**Postmortem**

Listen: imagine your  
body next to mine.  
Think of the knife  
that drew my thin spine

open. I am in a room  
so cold and lonely  
like the slow negative  
of a stone breaking

into water. One evening  
I asked you how to die  
this slow: smooth, bent  
along the edges of my grave.

Almost losing my way back home.
