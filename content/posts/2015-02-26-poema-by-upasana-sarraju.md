**I (or The End Of Life)  
** 

You talk sad.  
I talk expensive.

Potato tart appetisers  
are rare. Baby shrimp are rare.

But you dog!  
It is true.  
I am hungry.

Goodbye my waiter!  
It is closing time.

*

**II (or It Is The Nature of The Weightless To Soar)  
**  
Inside I am blue.  
You are invisible within.

For those watching  
you are an elegant dinosaur  
I am a blue whale  
drowning.

When you soar  
I cry  
for you  
for me.

*

**III (or Death By Sigh)  
** 

Your antstep sighs,  
the unnoticed soft infinity  
I hunger for, when

my lungs dance  
to the percussion  
of your lips.

*

**IV (or Identity)  
**  
I am a circle  
Living in a circle,  
Transparent  
diaphanous,  
light,  
but whole.

*

**V (or Silhouette Of a Boy I Find Beautiful)  
**  
An acquaintance breeze  
interrupts me.

He wafts in and out  
of my room  
every hour  
shattering my skin  
with every goodbye.

*

**VI**

A quiet indignity  
Adhered  
to my eyebrows  
even as, a riddle  
unravelled itself,  
giggling,  
into a mess of four-dimensional puns,  
thread and bees.

*

**VII (or A Quiet Ache)  
** 

The world is amazed  
to watch  
a cube,  
a quiet liar,  
chase after sculptures  
searching eyes  
for beauty  
that will burn.

*

**VII (or Nightmares of the heart)  
** 

That choking feeling  
The faint smell on breath  
that never truly washes away.

Some screaming day  
They will find me, only to  
Abandon me forever. 

*

**VIII (or Dramatic Mouse)  
**  
A dramatic mouse  
Stole my blanket  
The other night.  
He ran out the window  
Weighed down by my  
Purple, fuzzy blanket,  
Shouting,

“To cheese, or not to cheese!”

*

**IX (or Unconditional)  
**  
I would cut out my heart  
for you.  
But it is my surgeon’s daughter’s birthday.

Perhaps in the morning.

*

**X (or Solitude)  
** 

Solitude.

I like having company  
to ignore.

*
