**An Email on Sunday  
**  
Some emails  
are more difficult  
to receive  
from a child  
long out of college

the daughter who writes  
her cancer is back  
but the doctor says  
with chemo and surgery  
things should be fine

and all the while  
the father wonders  
why she didn’t call  
at midnight and let  
the telephone scream 

hysterically in the night  
to deliver the news  
a computer is too  
cold a messenger  
to deliver hot terror 

on Sunday morning  
while machine guns  
of sleet drive  
bullets too bright  
into the ground

\***
