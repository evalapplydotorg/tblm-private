**Home**

no one leaves home unless  
home is the mouth of a shark…  
—Warsen Shire

Home is an arrested metaphor  
suspended between my trust in clouds  
that shake their head when it rains  
and the news feed I scroll endlessly  
like my grandfather’s afternoon stroll  
down the abandoned lanes of faith.

Home is a suspected Kashmiri image  
under investigation of the security  
agencies that hang it upside down  
like an X-ray to look for the possible  
links of a deadly disease  
that might engulf the entire nation.

Home is a local ancient chinar tree  
that you write with your desires  
copied from the smiles of your ancestors  
slayed for saying what they preferred  
besides rice and potatoes on subsidized  
rates after years of organized Begar.

Home is a frozen smile that often plays  
on the silent lips of rebels buried alive  
under the weight of torched houses  
Abbu built inch by inch with mud and water  
borrowed from the fields through hours  
of toil and blood in mid-July.

Home is a _tschot_ that _mouj_ bakes  
on the ancestral hearth, her anchorage  
while she sings songs of Habba Khatoon;  
her cracked hands raise the dust of life  
lamenting the joys of youth and beauty  
before the muezzin’s call for prayer.

Home is the sky hanging above us  
where we fly our prayers before  
we expose our thoughts and heartbeat  
for regular security check-ups  
lest we plant the seeds of love and dreams  
and plead guilty of a conspiracy.

Home is a suspended hand of the clock  
gifted by my first love in high school  
that has given up the race for existence  
and adopted wilful ignorance of the time  
unless the soldiers knock down its walls  
for the last supper on its dead parts.

**August 5, 2019**

That day, Allah’s kerosene lamp gaped  
during the great auction, while they sold us  
along with our old Imambarha at Budgam  
refusing to see our shaking heads;  
We carried history in small coffins  
on shoulders like our dead ancestors  
to bury in the soil of memory.  
The air was stiff with the traps of empire.  
We hung the night on our heads  
and shook its last dust particles angrily  
for a life that was our undoing;  
We stood curfewed and implored God;  
He had been a judge in his dream;  
we had Hazratbal outside our lawn  
we beseeched the saint to be with us:  
_At least you have seen our women  
Drying cow-dung and storing poplar leaves  
For the coming winter._  
He did not speak this time; he never did!  
when we took pilgrimage to caves on the hill  
God had melted into the polluted waters of Dal;  
At last, we visited Jesus at the Gulmarg church  
they had hanged him─ his body frozen in ice;  
That day, we did not believe our eyes;  
we ran short─ of miracles and communications,  
of Gods and the saints; we had silence in abundance  
while two babies were delivered together  
_Handcuffed to history_  
their mothers gathered the colonial air  
in their cupped hands like the blessings of  
Shahe-i-Kirman and colonized them forever.
