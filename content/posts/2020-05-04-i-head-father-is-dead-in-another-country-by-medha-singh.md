**I Hear Father is Dead in Another Country**

One is as old as the days they remember.  
Some make us age quicker, better.

Some slow in pace: something between a wish  
and a prayer, something

that is both. Some call it hope. It’s not.  
Light sweeping the white sand, across

the cool and quiet sea. Here, his consoling hand  
on my face; fast arriving, a withered brow,  
reaching, touching,

brown, low. A breathing sound follows one here,  
to a world ebbing in the cormorant’s lair. He will

never now, come to comb my hair, to save me  
from the wrong affairs. _There_, the long shroud

falls from the sky, drops upon his corpse,  
makes its way to the pyre. Loud ash  
from other burning bodies

flying in my sister’s hair. Somewhere unknown  
among the birds, one will find his verse.

This black hearse grows roots in my bones,  
on a continent far, too far from home.

Palm fronds rustle. My eyes close.  
My tousled head is made of clouds.

**Crematorium**

At Nigambodh Ghat, who is waiting for death?

Why am I so at ease in this place.  
Where death is a detail, not an event.

Hephaestus minds the forge. _Hear_ the largeness  
of wheezing echoes in the Electric Crematorium.  
A momentum that extinguishes bodies, numbered  
to distinguish bodies, release their ghosts.  
One, two, three, oar. Charon opens the door.

Look now, here,  
a gulping throat withholding  
a withering hope.  
Is it a dream,  
_did it implode?_
