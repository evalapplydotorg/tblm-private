**When Shammi Kapoor slides down the snow  
** 

in Junglee, shouting &#8216;Yahoo&#8217;, they tell you it&#8217;s Kashmir  
but it is actually Kufri, near Shimla.

When Ranbir Kapoor climbs up the snow  
in YJHD, all moon-struck, they tell you it&#8217;s Manali  
but it is actually Gulmarg, in Kashmir.

So we&#8217;ve always got it wrong &#8211; grand-uncle or  
grand-nephew &#8211; and we&#8217;ve been like this for long, always  
Kashmir without Kashmiris, all for a song.

**Zeno’s Paradox for Getting Over Breakups  
** 

I know the day he went cut you in half  
and the day after that halved your half too.  
I know it didn’t stop. The next day you  
were half of the half of the half of what  
you once were. I know on the worst days  
how it pained. But notice how after all the  
cutting, some of you always remained.  
And then it grew one day when it rained.
