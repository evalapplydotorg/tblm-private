**Thanks to Jonathan Edwards**

Black spiders in my woodpile  
asterisk a sharp distinction  
between their brisk compaction  
and the expansive human view.  
These spiders aren’t the toxic  
species that gleam in cellars  
or crawl into children’s bunk beds.  
They’re only shy little blobs  
dedicated to devouring gnats.

Splitting oak and maple to burn  
on spangled winter nights, I brush  
these tiny creatures to safety  
without damaging their many  
but necessary legs. The image  
of a spider in a candle flame,  
thanks to Jonathan Edwards,  
has cursed literate New England  
for almost three hundred years.

I’d like to spider myself off  
to fresh quarters, new horizons,  
more limber self-expressions.  
If I could do it by compressing  
myself into an iota  
of punctuation I surely would.  
But my hulking muddle of flesh  
has committed itself to culture  
rather than nature, shriving itself  
of several vital dimensions  
that neither ink on paper  
nor the digital screen can display.

The rumble of the gas engine,  
the sheer of splitting firewood,  
the muscle of piling the product  
belong to the great world of work  
that every creature inhabits.  
But my daydreams of spiderhood  
empowered by simple purpose  
lilt into the stratosphere  
like so many runaway blimps.

**Everyone Seen in Profile**

Do you believe that the heft  
of our village keeps us happy?

Excess weight flattens landscapes  
and ruins laws of perspective.

Our former police chief pushes  
a belly as blunt as Moby-Dick.

A neighbor’s car squeals in its springs  
as she plumps into the driver’s seat.

We’re so bored with ourselves we eat  
objects of clashing colors

as if nutrition weren’t the issue.  
How long will drought and disease

edge us into private places  
where it’s hard to cast a shadow?

Why don’t the thin men of Haddam  
respond to our bleating and sighs?

When winter arrives, we’ll stand around  
drinking coffee in snowdrifts.

Unsafe to step indoors where  
viral thoughts linger long after

the subject has become a verb.  
For now, the autumn wind teases

with a moveable sterile field  
in which we enjoy our morning snack.

Eventually the town will collapse  
under the excess of its populace.

The river, astringent with drought,  
will equivocate for awhile.

**Morning Melody**

The light breaks into pieces small  
enough to swallow. This happens  
daily, but who notices? Lines  
of force stretch like kite strings.  
You expect me to do something  
with my hands, but arthritis  
has rendered them crude as paddles.

Let’s go downtown and drown  
our quarrels in large paper cups  
of high-acid java brewed  
to flush sinkers fried in deep  
fat fryers no one ever cleans.  
Fueled by this gastric adventure,  
we’ll face a full day of errands  
and shuck the scholarly ambitions  
that aroused us in our youth.

What good did all that scribbling  
on notecards do? Remember  
the abstractions of Derrida,  
Bachelard, Empson, Hegel?  
We dragged their books to the landfill  
years ago, purging our senses.

Now we live on the ignorant edge  
where the wind brawls from the south.  
Our angle of vision excludes  
the darker sides of planets  
that dangle in the night sky  
like demented Christmas ornaments.

No wonder the light seems fractured  
along those emphatic lines of force.  
Morning coffee usually comforts  
and heals the worst of our sins.  
But today the news is so bad  
the headlines kill even casual  
readers with stark efficiency.

Maybe we’ll stay home and listen  
for mice in the walls. Come outside  
and examine the world. The wreckage  
of last night’s freight of dreams lies  
rusting in the garden where  
we’re likely to trip over it,  
sprawling on our Mother Earth.

**Esthétique des Odeurs**

The dog has smelled everything,  
but not this. He recoils and plops  
droopy on the sidewalk, nonplussed.  
You laugh at his muddled expression,  
but something in terminal decay,  
if that’s what he thinks he’s sensing,  
troubles instinct and evolution.

Dogs are entitled to meditate  
on any odor they choose,  
usually preferring the fetid—  
but this defies meditation.  
You wonder if some political  
object passed, rubbing its thighs  
on the fence, leaving a spoor  
to attract the opposite sex.

“What sex is the opposite  
of politics,” I ask. You sigh,  
“the absence of sex and also  
the afterglow of fantasy sex.”  
The smell must be powerful enough  
to smelt all smells into one.  
The dog no longer works his nose—

some knowledge is best left unknown.  
Dogs admire the fragrance of death,  
rolling in carcasses to hide  
their own smell from enemies.  
Color-blind, they find color  
in the fourth dimension where scent  
becomes bravura of rhetoric.

You wish you could nose out crimes  
among our little coterie  
of town officials, lawyers, cops.  
I agree that the local riffraff  
offers a world of rotten objects  
we trod upon daily, soiling  
our shoes but offering subjects  
and verbs we can manipulate.

Despite what our favorite poet claims,  
evil lacks an aesthetic other  
than a range of bouquets a French  
parfumier would love to catch.  
The dog smelled something stronger,  
richer and more frightening  
than the usual bundle of sins.

You examine the fence. Nothing  
but a slight gray stain as if  
some aged person had shed  
a year or two in passing. I kneel  
in the grass and touch the spot.  
I can’t smell it, but its texture  
is rough as the tongue of a cat.

The dog growls. He objects to  
further inquiry. The sun occludes  
itself, tucked into cloud. You bark  
a warning, but the moment passes,  
and you and I and the dog look  
ashamed for fussing over  
some lunatic notion long past.

**The Dogs Have Learned to Talk**

All the dogs have learned to talk.  
They’re discussing the rising cost  
and poor ingredients of pet food.  
They won’t speak to their owners,  
but when I ask a passing boxer  
his name, he replies, “Aloysius.”

You’re undisturbed by this glib  
new phenomenon. Perched  
on a metal chair on the lawn  
before the bookstore, you indulge  
your bitter appetite, preferring  
a lumpy scone to conversation.

Do you think that public discourse  
has gone to the dogs? October  
is almost here, your favorite month.  
I had hoped we would hike in hills  
of seasonal flamboyance, shedding  
the bulge of a summer of leisure.

I had hoped that some great logic  
would empower us when alone  
with vees of geese honking overhead.  
The dogs talk so loudly no one  
merely human can interrupt.  
Although leashed to their masters,

the dogs have seized control without  
a hint of violence. Their diction  
is perfect, their sense of the bon mot  
enviable. Finish your scone  
and allow me a sip of your coffee.  
I hope that when we get home

our cats remain as wordless  
and private as always. I wish  
I could emulate their stance  
despite the oceans of language  
heaving between us, between us  
and whatever’s about to evolve.
