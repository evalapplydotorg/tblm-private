**Sunday**

Sunlight and anxiolytic flora  
drink themselves silly;  
an eastern pinch of sky blurts  
like it forgot to take its pills.  
The worm has wept  
all Sunday while you were  
reading the newspaper.  
Of watering the taste of a fleck  
of midnight fruit between your teeth.  
Of the hummingbird, disturbed  
by the sound of hideous undressing,  
again leaving the portrait  
of uncut happiness  
unfinished in the whorl.  
Mist rises toward  
the balcony and leaves  
a trace on the rails.  
V is in the kitchen rinsing  
the stained cloth.  
Wind bends a shrub,  
exposing its mangled roots.  
An unsettling wave of sound  
rises from the valley:  
like it’s time to hear  
what has made through;  
clouds rushing in like the early  
death of someone you never knew.

**Your Father’s Shirt**

_For A_

No matter how many times I was told  
that the russet stain on it was paint  
my mind only saw blood.  
First blood, then paint, then disbelief.  
I never believed you, my sense of worth  
didn’t let me, I fathered my fear until  
it turned friendly. My son usurped me.  
What you gave up slowly revives, greening  
above the surface, but the mind  
meanders toward what it first sees.  
I failed to see your longing for your father  
as a footnote to me. How could any love  
that drew from within the same source  
as your love for him, its dedication, be untrue?  
I was deceived by my destiny of fathers.  
In my life’s revolutions of fathers, my answer,  
too, was disguised in a father, but the mind  
meanders toward what it first sees.  
First father, then fear, then flounder.

**Montparnasse**

On closer inspection there was nothing  
that suggested dehydration,  
maybe it was merely our differences  
of opinion turning you a pale green.  
Somebody must love you like this.  
I wanted the forlorn and nugatory cookie  
of graves, you wanted water.  
At the tomb I saw fresh birdshit  
and greatly resisted analogous  
strokes of joy with his work.  
This would be the last cemetary  
we were ever going to visit together.  
There would be enough time  
for literature and birdshit.  
But it was you who said  
‘Hey, that looks like a fingerprint,  
there on the shit.’  
And true enough it was.  
I wanted to kiss the bird’s cloaca,  
then you, then whoever’s hand  
that finger belonged to.  
You kneeled beside the tap to drink.  
Sunlight, the bad actor, crashed through  
the maples. My lines to him I forgot,  
my lines to you I whispered into the water.  
The tomb gave its best, did nothing at all.  
Far at the entrance the guard explained  
something to an old woman.  
She looked like she understood.

**Son of**

The part of the mind that is  
infallible has been unkind  
in general to my friends.  
I always see them digging  
furiously under the shade  
of a large tree.  
Their parents are, of course, already dead.  
And I almost say to myself  
“How lucky.” but my mind is drawn  
To loose strips of plastic fluttering  
on some high branch.  
And I say to myself  
“dead or alive you’ll be unlucky.”  
There is no part of the mind that is  
kind or infallible.  
Dead friend, friendly dread,  
dear sound of furious digging,  
day has barely begun and I already  
cannot drink anymore.
