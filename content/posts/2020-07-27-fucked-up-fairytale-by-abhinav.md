**Fairytale**

The princess is nagging  
The frog to sing  
Before a kiss

&#8220;Are you kidding me&#8221; he says  
I have nothing for nose  
Nothing like an Adams apple

Saying this, he spits on her face  
And she turns into a cricket  
Burdened with a broken violin

Together they are now the greatest  
Band of the night in swamps  
He is croaking notes while she

Rubs her hairy legs

\***
