**Hello, Brother**  
_(A reflection of Zubair Ahmed’s poem of the same name)_

Sometimes during quiet summer  
afternoons when everyone is  
asleep, I sit at your desk.  
They took away your half  
of the bunk-bed anyway.  
Aai still calls your name  
in our empty house  
and Papa sits very still.  
I think he pretends  
not to be listening for you.  
Sometimes I will look down  
and imagine I am you instead  
or that I can see us still  
racing each other for the sake of it.  
Rani barks at our ankles, and  
when the breeze makes coconuts  
fall on car roofs and foreign films  
play back to back on TV  
we bond like hydrocarbons.  
And the monsoon—dirty rain,  
Aai taking us out for walks, pressing  
your hands in hers and mine, three  
of us, slowly, and damp.  
Rani is dead now, no dog now  
but then at night, we fall asleep  
to the sound of you telling me  
how instead of God, a giant brain  
floating in space, controls the world.  
You did not need to—I already knew.
