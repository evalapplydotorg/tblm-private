She says nothing, and how.  
The radio plays a dirge  
for December. Then when walking  
was going from verse to worse  
in the hay of our years, she infiltrated  
the moonlight in my beers. My toothpaste  
wasted on her charcoal lips.  
The things I could do were few  
and the things I couldn&#8217;t fewer.  
The drugged street lamps; the lost  
rickshaws in their long slumber. Now  
she extends herself like a theorem  
to the trigonometry of our last strife.  
The France in her head is long liberated.  
How a yes can destroy your life.
