**touchscream**

diwali outside, & names smoke on my tongue  
with the taste of burning diyas / in the TV’s

glitching glow the blue chips packet is passed  
around, the remote has a coat of masala magic

from our fingers / with a touch, I harvest red  
notification blossoms on green whatsapp boughs

watch the single tick split into two, then turn  
blue under the dotted shade of typing, online

typing, last seen, typing… click on clickbaits  
to be proven right / like a worm in the damp

soil of the internet, hooked onto a promise of  
water, however salty, only to come undone in

an algorithm of annuli / scroll thumbnails on  
pornsites, looking for something the shape of

us / but not clicking on it, guilted by what I am  
looking for / when a rare torrent finds a firm

seed, I feel the world might just get along sharing  
touchscreen dreams from broken echochambers

in the 3am heat, a hum through a flame of clapping  
hands becomes a hymn / apocalyptically lit blue

packets of petrol pumps dot my dream like masala  
magic fireflies alighting on the branches of a dark

country creeping north / I wake up shooting pebbles  
across eddying shallows of my mind to roiling blues

of my body & trace its descent into the phosphorous  
dark while being kneedeep in it myself / I wake up

under a blue blanket patterned with leaves fleshing  
peach at the tips, burned by fireworks of yesterday

*

**homecome**

by morning, we arrive & the first thing I see  
is the hand pipe planted in the front yard with

a hose running all the way to the toilet in the  
back fitted with a new western / grandpa gets

up from his armchair & looks at us & sinks back  
in the last of his skin holding onto his bones with

fingers around an inhaler / as he breathes into it  
the capsules inside swirl like anchovies / it isn’t

as easy as it used to be, he says / we cousins sit in  
silence & watch the justcleared sky with a harp of

smoke strung by a singing wingspan / come see me  
if you want to see me alive for the last time, he had

said to his children & his children came, taking us  
along / I find the last VHS of my parents’ marriage

unspooling quietly in a rotting closet but not  
before they salvaged it onto a hard disk / but not

without pink & green glitchstains / dad cuts banana  
leaves & aunt serves us fish in it that tastes more of

earth than water / a single strand of steelwool is then  
a memory sitting down crosslegged on the winterfed

mosaic floor / a luxury to have made hunger patient  
by habit / the children keep forgetting what they came

for / their father on his armchair in the verandah, inhaler  
to his lips like the beedis in his youth, talking of spirits

that have stopped coming because they’re afraid of  
electric lines / regrets his career in the electricity board

but collects his pension anyway / pointing at spots in the sky  
where rainclouds snakecharm peacocks / it thunders like gods

cocked a gun into clouds & went bang / a dog takes cover  
under a coconut / my cousin on his phone returns a smile

that sinks somewhere between us before ebbing again  
at the first scent of his ringtone / it isn’t as easy as it

used to be / there will be ash on our shuttles as we  
homecome / it is purple evening & we have to do

something / we shuffle a deck of cards stitched  
together from two incomplete sets / a game of

donkey becomes the saltburdened mule with each  
passing round / the smoke of the kerosene lamp

licks my grandma’s portraits in which she was  
edited into a sari she never wore with a necklace

she never had / to show we already had what we  
have gained / at night a whiff of the mat with its

fraying weave undoing the palmfuls of effort wished  
into it / we resort to grandma’s old saris sunk in mothballs

of closeted air / the glitchstained TV is plugged out  
to make way for the table fan/ from the stool it scans us

like a god’s judgment encrypted in a theory of winds  
as we go to take a piss before we go to sleep / it thunders

but the tired sky only grumbles with ghosts clouded  
in wrinkles / the toilet has a rope so that grandpa can get up

by himself / burnt firewood ash meets the ebbing of the water  
all the way from the yard pipe / we boys can go in the woods

so we go to rain & come back wet / wait for the others to return  
& look at grandma’s portrait with a garland shriveled to rosary

when everyone has returned we go to sleep under old saris  
spirited with windy judgments / I dream of a dog with a spine

of sawdust walking through a dam of coconut shells to unbury  
a VHS & some pills & a corpse of a fat lizard / by next morning  
we depart, waving hands to erase some inevitable unseen shape
