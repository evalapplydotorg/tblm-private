draft: true
author: Aishwarya Iyer
category: fiction
issue: 55
summary: "\"I have always imagined Paradise,\" Borges the Liar wrote, \"will be
  a kind of library.\" Aishwarya Iyer's story seems to suggest that if that is
  true (the lie, not the liar), then Purgatory may be imagined as a plague,
  perhaps even a plague of texts.  "
