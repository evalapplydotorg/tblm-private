**Stray**

A stray thought enters my head  
and ambles across  
with the nonchalance of cattle  
let loose by their owner  
to wreak havoc on the neighbour’s farm.

It tramples all other thoughts,  
and bites off some more  
that have managed to grow  
in the crevices of my skull  
&#8211; like plants sprouting out of fantastic ruins.

I move to the window  
to spit out the unwanted guest  
but stop at the sight  
of a lady in green:  
swinging her hips, singing her ware.

Do they still exchange old clothes for new vessels?

My thoughts are like old clothes:  
torn, tattered, faded. Would I barter them  
for new ones like the sparkling stainless steel boxes  
inside which your fine reflection waits  
to snare you, trap you in its embrace for posterity?

I dig out a saree -my wedding attire-  
and place it in front of her. She inspects  
every inch and smiles. “Perfect . . . no holes!”  
she says, handing me a box that reflects  
the splendour of her paan-stained lips. I laugh.

The holes are in my heart, not in the six yards of red cloth.

A dog cranes his neck towards me  
trying to read my thoughts. I look away.  
With an angry growl, he runs into my thoughts  
chases away the cattle and wrests control of the field.  
“Chal hat!” I yell, my eyes glowering.

The dog drops down my head  
and walks out my mouth  
but not before sniffing out  
my most secret thoughts  
and lapping them up with his sordid pink tongue.

Furious, I trap him  
in my newly acquired box  
and stow it away in the same corner  
that had housed my saree  
these last thirty years.

**The House they Sold**

Sell it! They chorused  
and it was sold. Just like that.  
A hundred years of history  
-held not by lime and mortar  
but by a billion stories-  
waits to be erased. The dust

that rises as I step in  
is not just any dust; each speck  
is steeped in ecstasy, tragedy,  
drama and absurdity  
or the intricate mundaneness  
of everyday living.

I fill a jar with that dust and shut it tight.

A jar full of ghosts: I place it  
under the open skies  
to see the specks waltz  
under the harsh afternoon sun  
and float dreamily  
under the moonlight.

I pull out two chairs  
-one for me, one  
for the ghost of my ancestor.  
Together, we survey the remains  
of a time buried under a heap  
of putrid memories.

I ask her the secret of her longevity.

She answers through the fruit-bats  
that have made home in the dark attics  
and the termites that have eaten through  
the teakwood floorboards  
and the rats that have secretly copulated  
and populated the basement.

What is family?  
The blood that runs through my veins  
is not my own, it is the DNA of ancestors  
blended and pureed into a fine chutney.  
Are my thoughts my own thoughts?  
Life goes on. Life moves

out of one house, into another,  
then another . . . a wandering nomad.  
Should a house hold on to you  
with puppet strings  
or you, the house?
