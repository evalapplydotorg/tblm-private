**Isosceles Majesty**

It fluttered into sight,  
forming ripples  
on the night&#8217;s cool surface &#8211;  
a faint beacon of grey,  
the outlines blending.  
It settled on the doorframe,  
within reach of my tiny palms,  
and I caught a glimpse of a plump body  
tapering to a pointy end.  
It would have been  
merely incongruous  
without the isosceles majesty  
of swept-back wings &#8211;  
stiff, powder-coated, frantic,  
flapping in my fumbling grasp.  
I grabbed the strange creature.  
I let it go.  
The faint smudges on my fingers  
spelled out the unspoken language  
of the world.  
I won&#8217;t say I understood the signs.  
I didn&#8217;t know then  
that I would outgrow the lure of moths,  
that the world would go on  
to leave deeper marks on me.  
Now I realise  
how the dust of a moth&#8217;s wing  
becomes precious  
when it is given away,  
how softness, too, can leave  
its indelible mark.

**At the Cafe**

Along this shore,  
where countless histories  
wash away  
in a turgid tide of plastic,  
the absence of the past  
hums like mosquitoes.  
In the streetside cafe,  
a tablespoon turns  
the evening sun into lava.  
A cappuccino&#8217;s steam parses  
the afternoon silences long enough  
to let languid words breathe.  
A taxicab rumbles by.  
The song playing loudly on its radio  
applies to the couple on the motorbike  
roaring past, with her red-tipped hands  
around his brawny arms,  
her buttocks framing his.  
There you smile in the cafe chair  
with the ease of shedding another skin.  
You talk of this and that.  
I want to shake you, shout  
that the fact is, I realise,  
I have crossed the midpoint;  
I am now closer  
to death than to birth.  
So don&#8217;t tell me about your job,  
your commute, your past, even your life.  
Tell me your way of seeing  
this shore, this beach.  
Show me how you stop time,  
if only for a moment.  
But yet again  
I bite back my words  
and let you ramble on.  
Because I want to see you again.  
The sound of the foamy waves  
washing away the sand  
is drowned out in traffic  
that also ebbs and flows.
