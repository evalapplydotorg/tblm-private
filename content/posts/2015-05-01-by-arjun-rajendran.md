**Hotel Lobby: Sultanahmet Istanbul  
**  
After the mosque and the church, some chestnuts,  
after the rain— every drop a passport  
to misery— we return to a room not housekept.  
As we wait, we’re offered Turkish tea and Apple tea.  
The family next to us is, we learn, from Germany.  
Well, they’re Iraqis from Germany. We’re Indians  
from America. But this evening, we’re all in the lobby  
of a hotel in Sultanahmet: united against  
the weather, armed with tea, conversing about  
our adopted lands, kvetching about the cost  
of food in this tourist district, how to bargain for lamps,  
the cheat who drove us from Taksim, why they will  
never return to Baghdad; sharing snippets from our lives  
to keep the windy evening outside our thoughts,  
from gripping our bones with visited sorrows  
till we only remember places we’re here to forget.

**Four Segments, Five Recurrences

A stranger is showing me his poetry collection-I’m envious it’s thicker  
than mine. The book is a folio of medical records, prescriptions,  
x-rays and a photo of a poem written as a healing exercise.

My grandma just died and I’m in mourning. My father, the atheist,  
is telling me not to worry. Points to her rice colored footprints  
made overnight on his office floor: see, she’s still here.

The second round of a job interview. Scientists pass by smiling  
ever so politely. I’m specifically told not to sit in view  
of the camera as their shareholders shouldn’t know they are  
hiring immigrants. I’m tense. Nobody’s asking me questions.  
What’s the plan for today? I ask. Today we sit  
back and relax, watch some porn.

I’m talking in French with a Bonbon girl in Paris. I think je voudrais  
will sound better than je veut. It turns out the girl is actually  
from England. Embarrassed, I order some Bonbons in English.

I’m in an open area. The air thick with metals smelting. Blue  
tanks line the walls. To each tank, one child, covered  
up to the neck in hot water. The children are  
screaming “ow, ow, ow”. What’s happening??? I ask. Someone  
replies it’s to increase the chemo’s efficacy.

I ask the Bonbon girl when she’s getting off work. The women  
around her snigger. We realize neither of us is single. Agree  
there’s no harm in a fling.

In the last tank, a boy of eight. He’s breathing comfortably  
at the bottom and playing Mahjong. I pull out  
my cell phone surreptitiously, click his pic. I dream  
of the likes I’ll get in that photography forum.

I’m pretending not be hurt by his disinterest toward my collection

Two queues of workers in construction hats; I have the job  
and it begins with me sitting on a concrete block  
between sick children in tanks and mutes looking past me.
