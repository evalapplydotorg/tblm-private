Night breaks apart like pomegranate seeds in my  
palm.  
The juice is everywhere, but who can see things when  
they spill?

There&#8217;s only the smell and the incense of the heart  
vomiting into the night. The night has been cut short,  
the dream severed.

The dream like an octopus chewing the naked sense  
of being.  
What strangeness that myth and reality come like  
twins?

As long as the juice burns the hand, its exotic smell  
slips  
blood thawing on the wrist; it doesn&#8217;t matter. I skip  
medicine&#8211;

the aftertaste sings in my body like a Bloody Mary. In  
the dream,  
I am both dead and alive. I wake having swallowed my  
own death.

In the dream, I am man, woman, animal and light, all  
with a jarring sense of night. The night a mad rider  
with red hair.

In this dream, the mind eats the body and spits it to  
make the day.  
In this dream, I am the vivid strain of fear. I am bright  
red and dimming

black. In the dream, I can be anything but this.  
This ugliness, these damp sheets. This blindness,  
how myth and reality come intertwined. Hard to say  
which is which.
