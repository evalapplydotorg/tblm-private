**&#8220;After all, Punjabi is spoken on both sides of the border, divided only by the script&#8221;~  
**  
This is the splintering. This is the passport  
which still reads Lahore,  
India. This is also the indiscretion. What  
no scrubbing can erase, for the way  
sameness seeps through cracks and  
makes itself known. To speak my father&#8217;s  
tongue is to be absent. It is to wash one&#8217;s  
hair with unknown waters and allow  
the knots to remain. To speak this way  
is to be stranded in a different time,  
to trace his home as though it were mine.  
And I am still turning it around in my hands. 

My father&#8217;s tongue has survived  
in parts. So will I.

**&#8220;Rochester at Daryaganj Sunday Market&#8221;  
** 

The vendor tapes the paperback shut.  
He fools most. But it isn&#8217;t new.  
And after two rounds of haggling  
he opens it saying look,  
it is worth more my price  
than yours. Take a cheaper one if–  
but the foxing stains give it away.  
We each compromise  
and it is mine. A copy in grey and white,  
a _Wide Sargasso Sea_. 

On flipping through, later  
I find the pages curling  
with dampness. The spine, too,  
is frail. Only a small nudge  
and it will come apart.  
Just like that.

But I am already in the metro; the skies  
are falling. The sorrow over a bad bargain  
must be reaped, quickly.
