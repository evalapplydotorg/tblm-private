**August Twenty-Twenty**

This has been the longest not-August,  
the unwieldy-est still-March, my windows fogged with tomorrow’s forecast and  
the receipts of the past. I wish

for nothing in particular. A return seems unimaginable, but an un-return sends my trembling fingers to the  
blurred edges of time. I am asked

to let go, so instead I sit at the ledge  
with a hand dangling outside, collecting rain for warmer days, when perhaps

we will lie – backs flat – against the yellowed  
grass and laugh about the year we thought

the world was going to end  
again and again.

**two winters in Dilli**

i  
dust is being / crumbling skylines  
ginger my tea / the ash

lingers in my mouth / roof thick with  
grime and pigeon feather /

in the winter of our bones / a future of decay /

ii  
February / they come preying in broad / battered sunlight  
the roar of orange-blue flames drowning out the  
dying embers of a working man’s firewood in the  
harshest of winters /

toes twirling into the down of the rajai  
we mull over the Air Quality Index / we joke  
soon we will be wearing masks in the living room

crumbling skylines pepper my plate /

iii  
it is October / fingers snagging like wool / pink against  
hair / we stumble into the pharmacy / a man eyes a

packet of sanitary pads fearfully / his mask a bird  
perched precariously on the bough of his chin/ we  
escape soon enough / snickering / grins drowned out  
by the noise of cotton/

names snag in our throats /

in the winter of our bones, decay /  
we shimmer / oblivious /  
blue and bright in the wind / thick with  
grime and pigeon feather /

love in the time of –

iv  
what happened last February?

v  
dust is being / the plague floods the plains and the  
plague carries us away / but this city remains /

vi  
what is a February?

vii  
what is a pogrom?

viii  
toes twirling into the down of the rajai /  
you reach across

thumb the tip of my nose / i sniff  
the lingering stench of a crumbling  
skyline /

ix  
in the winter of our bones / desecration /

god buried herself under the fractured minarets  
and its mortar settles white and flaky on our scalps /  
a reminder of the losses we do not number /

x  
i count every day we stay apart /

xi  
i stop counting /

xii  
what is dust?

xiii  
it is November /

i don’t balk at the taste of crumbling  
skylines anymore /

i am too busy burning the rajai that  
has stiffened in your absence /

its ash settling smog on my shoulders /
