**First Person**

I’m sure I initially saw you, the mandrill,  
in a children’s illustrated photographic book or  
possibly in a _National Geographic_ pictorial and  
I always think the same thing about your cream teeth and  
Union Jack black red and blue mask  
I always think the same thing  
you are beautiful you are terrifying

I think, all hail the surreal primate troll  
I think, the mammal clown with garish smeared soft  
greasepaint crayons marking up your mask and  
and I always think the same thing  
in passing grades of As, Bs, 70%, firsts  
you stalk the textbooks  
of anthropology students and teachers and  
and I always think the same thing  
we the students and I try to think about  
misogynist priority of access theories and  
and I always think the same thing  
you are beautiful like Halloween is beautiful and  
and you are terrifying like Halloween is terrifying and  
and it’s not October yet and  
and it’s the middle of a pandemic and  
and it’s what James Baldwin says when  
I think about you says more about me

I don’t mean to call myself beautiful but  
but perhaps I’m terrifying to others  
marked up by lipstick and  
and it’s what James Baldwin says when  
when I think about you says more about me  
alright then you are gorgeous you are beloved  
you are witty you are friendly you will live to old age with  
with the love of your life have happy grandchildren and  
and a German shepherd mix  
have the love of your family and  
and your friends and the admiration and  
and lust of those you desire  
you are safe you are healthy you will achieve every  
every dream you aspire to achieve you  
you will rip off your  
my mask  
behind it I  
you will see  
see your  
my blue nose your  
my red nostrils your  
my stripes

**Train from Brighton, Several Years Before We Broke Up**

A lake superior of bluebells.  
The train stopped to let us have a gander.  
The purplebells, bluebells had usurped  
the traditional green and brown of  
forest ground, flooded over the dull  
olives and muds, rubber country boots and jackets  
woodstuff alchemy to purple and blue  
purple and blue  
– purple and blue, to me and you –  
through the window glass we heard it when  
the birds chittered  
the train knit-purled to shaky rolls once more  
and in a minute we passed into a view of a parking lot,  
with no shopping centre to qualify it.  
Car upon car upon purple  
metal upon blue metal upon red  
metal upon silver metal upon yellow  
metal inexplicable yet scarab-lovely in its own way  
to my newly bluebelled eyes, and  
perhaps for you the same,  
till the planes flew by and I knew it  
for the airport lot it was.

**I’m Definitely Missing the Links Here**

_Proconsul_ is hypothesised to be  
a candidate for the last common  
ancestor a deferential potential  
abdication to _Nyanzipithecus alesi_  
supplanting notwithstanding.  
She arrives in theoretical yesterday through  
necromancy in our jungle paradise  
el dorado mamilla as a given  
to ruminate and birth control  
all six living apes, her whole shebang:  
humans, chimpanzees, bonobos,  
gorillas, orangutans, gibbons.

We usually only see _Proconsul_  
rock-and-roll in the fake  
but familiar scala naturae. Debatably good intentions  
auxiliar for the story but, as just one defect,  
the scale incorrectly shows the state  
of primate evolutions as a sole  
progression towards adult European  
human males as ultimate solutions.

Through an arrow-linear and narrow scale  
from the Miocene to the present,  
such a directed model of the in-between  
is simple and seductive but reductively  
stopbottles all other humans and other  
animals who are themselves  
accrescent from its tiers.  
Like all the apes – including us –  
_Proconsul_ had no tale.
