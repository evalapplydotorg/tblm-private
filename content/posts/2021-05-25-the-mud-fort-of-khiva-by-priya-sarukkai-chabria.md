Crenulated by ancient toil this  
wall of sand stands against  
the sky and stretches. At night it  
turns homely: restaurants light  
up its alleys. We get drunk on  
its shrunken size and our  
escape from the guide’s  
intoning of its history.  
Especially

the slave chambers, ferret  
holes in which they were  
shoved, stacked and sold –  
on which Khiva thrived  
for centuries. The cages  
aren’t empty but thick  
with pleading eyes  
poached by time. Their  
flayed lives tinge our  
wine with tannin  
however much we pretend  
otherwise. Their fingers lick  
the contours of my dreams  
with screams in unknown  
tongues that are my own.

Above the ramparts  
dawn’s silk looms-  
turning in duration  
beyond right and wrong.  
Breaking into my room – a  
shakuhachi’s notes. There  
he stands at the massive  
gate, the tourist, his back to  
me, playing for the slaves. I  
listen from my balcony.

He turns. We bow to  
each other and depart  
for distant lands.
