**Petaled Geography**

We grow plants uncommon in

Pennsylvania. Like cotton.  
Cotton bolls, our own bit of Georgia.  
Did they miss red soil? And plumeria,  
Hawaii in a container. Salmon-colored  
blossoms. We’ve never been to Hawaii  
so we brought it here. Red adeniums,  
Madagascar beside our shed.  
Tall Mexican sunflowers call to us  
each morning. Orange, a song  
which they will teach us. Mexico  
on a thick stalk. In late fall,

I take in what can’t survive.  
Geography warm by our window,  
countries by a watering can.

**Witch**

Hey&#8211;I am above your head.  
You look for a broomstick  
that I never needed.

I am travel.  
I appear where I like.
