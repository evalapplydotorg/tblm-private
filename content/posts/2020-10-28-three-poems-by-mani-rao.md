**Writing on the Wall**

On the heels of the siren  
A hissing undertow

Back-bending sea-oats  
Palm fronds frisked  
Static in the aquarium

White knuckles on the horizon surely  
higher than our roof

_Horseshoes hung down on the beach  
Will cavalry recede_  
_  
_ _Between magnet shore and magnet moon  
Won’t ocean float_

Sorry fish so sorry garden

A fist mounted the ocean and scrawled on the promenade:  
_Equality_

*

**No Souvenir**

After the hurricane, scour  
the sand for wholeness  
in seashells

Chips and shards mirroring  
breakers and stars, they’re  
security, eyes of the beach

Face down snug  
insignia on their back, they  
carry the world, do not touch

Ears blown  
Spine spiralx posed  
Toss back to the breeze

*

**April 13, 2006**

The way the tornado wailed  
Lips to the rim

Flower and needle  
Unsheathed tip

Curling growl  
as it landed

Shaking in the basement  
We ate the smell

We wept

Wept for it  
Wept for us

for days on our knees begging  
for a photograph intact

among the toothpicks
