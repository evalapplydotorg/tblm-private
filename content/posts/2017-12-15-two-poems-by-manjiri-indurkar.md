**Diabetes at a Birthday Party  
**  
On a channel, a day late in celebrating  
Lata Mangeshkar’s birthday,  
plays a song where Sadhana promises to haunt her lover  
and Ma pierces a needle in her large stomach  
pushing insulin into her body  
_diabetes_, she reminds me, _will eat your bones_.

if you ever look at pictures  
of those suffering from rheumatoid arthritis  
you will find the bones parting ways from each other.  
Ma’s bones haven’t begun that journey yet  
but if diabetes wins this war of diseases  
they may not have to.

_This is not a good Lata song_, Baba complains  
_so many songs to choose from and they play this_  
he complains the way Ma complains about the needle  
that has broken inside her skin

Baba whose knees hurt when he bends them  
is a perfect candidate for a Moov commercial  
_Aah se Aahatak_  
he says with a conviction  
that has been practiced over years. 

He claims to have reached the place  
only Yudhistir could, but came back  
because he isn’t fond of dogs  
because I was eating Maggi and waiting for him 

His stomach is hard, dried-up in the sun  
frozen in time  
from selling daris to people.  
He narrated an O’ Henry story on his retirement  
and everyone looked puzzled, but impressed  
_which Henry was this_, they asked,  
I, II, III, IV?  
turning him into a historian when he  
just wanted to be a storyteller

I was always cautious of not using Ma’s comb  
dandruff was contagious, I always thought  
but it turned out to be hereditary.  
Sometimes out of boredom  
I scratch my head and watch dandruff snowflakes  
fall on my keyboard.  
my scalp bleeds silently as I pick the white chunks  
spreading on my head like the map of Scandinavia 

A different Lata song is being played now  
Ma likes indulging in trivia  
_Priya Rajvansh was Naveen Nischal’s best friend_,  
she informs her audience  
_Betaab dil ki tammana yahi hai_  
she sings complaining  
about her broken voice that can’t hold a note  
_diabetes_, she reminds me, _will eat your vocal chords_.

And I wonder silently,  
who talks about diabetes at someone’s birthday party?  
Ma’s life is a cautionary tale.

**My Mother Sings Disco Diwane  
**  
When I am seven, Aai undergoes a surgery  
to remove cysts blocking her breasts.  
I fall asleep in the math class and dream of her.  
She wears a hipster headband in my dream, like Rekha  
in _Ek toh kam zindagani_, but sings a different song.  
Rekha, my mother’s namesake, tries to wake me up,  
But Judy Jones, my class teacher, pushes her away  
and I don’t get a gold star for my homework that day.

When she comes back from the hospital  
I ask her about the song she was singing in my dream.  
She teaches me _Raat aur din diya jaale_ that night,  
and I win our colony’s Sa Re Ga Ma Pa,  
with popular consensus.  
So I get to sit on the lap of Aazoba’s friend  
for as long as I like. 

Aai’s stomach bears three biblical crosses  
from a recent gallbladder removal surgery.  
With the stretch marks from two pregnancies  
and several small scars from the insulin needle  
crowding her stomach, Aai’s body  
is the bloodiest site of worship. 

She complaints of being addicted to laxatives,  
every night, she drinks 10ml of EMTY,  
and jokes about it not emptying her stomach well enough.  
She wakes up from her afternoon nap saying,  
_It would be great if I could pass some gas_,  
and starts singing _Disco Diwane_, as if  
it’s the cure for constipation.

Aai, the pop sensation of the 80s is back again today.  
Ahaan!
