**Cabbage Moth**

Mother is watching a video about raagi  
flour and how to knead her way into father’s  
heart. I’m sure it’s why she makes gooseberry pickles now.  
I am reading about sloth bears eating mahua flowers.  
My mind, matryoshka doll-like, forgets things.  
I am mouthing “ursine”, “scat”, “crepuscular” so  
I will remember to tell _him_. I forget.  
The woman in the video is talking about buttermilk  
and consistency and taste. Mother tells me  
how Naani liked plain things like us, pure. No cardamom  
in her kheer. No cinnamon in her food. How sometimes  
I flick my hand like hers, pushing the air away  
like a dervish renouncing this world.  
How she loved mangoes too.  
She never tells me much more. I watch mother’s eyes  
wander. I imagine Naani opening whorls of  
cabbage like entering a space beyond us – my mother,  
a child still, stands there, watching a moth enter  
her mother’s mind, chewing at the leaves, fluttering  
out of control.

**Elephant Orifices**

_“Instructions for living a life:  
Pay attention.  
Be astonished.  
Tell about it.”_  
&#8211; Mary Oliver

My petal-eyed beloved texts me,  
asks me, what _are you doing?_

I play his soft voice in my head,  
each syllable drawing me in,  
like a seeker to gnosis.

But I’m looking at the long,  
ancient necks of roofed turtles. 

I’m wondering about the sound  
of two hard carapaces clashing  
like coconut shells. 

I’m thinking of beetles  
that light up their abdomens –  
sauntering gaily into the magnificence  
of elephant orifices –

How their thick, sleepy trunk must inhale  
such bioluminescence,  
while their grey bodies crush  
a field of green grass below.

I want to reply _I love you_.  
But there is just so much fauna. 

What if while I’m texting him, a sangai  
wanders onto some giant phumdi?  
Or a jacana lays her eggs on an old lily pad?

Who will notice then, the luciferin,  
churning like small star jasmines  
in the moist cave of a pachyderm’s nose?

**After Louise Glück’s “Matins”  
**  
_“Noah says depressives hate the spring”  
_  
Cuttlefish and octopuses:  
I don’t know how to start a poem.

The singer sings of a dead calm and  
I misread it as clam. I’m always looking  
For ecology. _Happy as a clam_. More like  
Waiting in the mangroves with pincers  
Of a crab. 

It is spring. Nobody cares.

A semul stands still as a painting on fire.  
Flamingos are asleep in the creek.  
The coral is burning with baya weavers. 

_So what_ I say.

**Lohri**

We take rounds of the Lohri fire  
like a forgotten ritual  
we are forced to participate in

How this corn crackling in the fire,  
splintering like old wood, mocks me,  
embarrasses my thin roots  
when my feet refuse to change  
into bold hops that make the bhangra  
or my hands fail to sway  
femininely to perform a gidda

No tumbi plays in my forlorn heart

Whenever I think of my love –  
I don’t think of the urban legend of Heer  
and Ranjha crossing rivers, or of crows acting  
like messengers between lovers

I recognize the sound of an alghoza  
as a grating reminder of the songs  
I cannot sing, in a language,  
I do not know how to speak

I weave a broken tappa of syllables

I am Jugni, far from any idyllic field of maize

Jugni, running thick like rancid buttermilk

Jugni, sizzling like revdi in the holy fire

Jugni, untethered like a kite from a long spool of manjha

Jugni, uprooted like a twig on the waters of Jhelum

**September Evening**

I woke up to the amplified, booming sounds  
of popular Bollywood tunes changed  
to Govinda-themed lyrics –  
about baby Krishna and his butter-stealing shenanigans  
I wondered if Vasu ran a temperature – wading  
across the cold, black lapping waters of Yamuna  
and what scientific group did the beautiful Vasuki belong to  
_Tujhe gharaat nahi paani ghaaghar, govinda re gopala_  
I was rubbing my nose and running a fever  
without having saved an infant –  
While my mother brought me a bowl of pomegranates  
and as if biting into them with my eyes I popped a zit on my nose.  
A blob of bright red blood oozed – spreading  
like scores of scarlet minivets netting the sky,  
like Kansa dying – the red reminding me  
of the blood-soil of Kurukshetra,  
of the oil-mixed vermillion paste smeared by mother  
on our kuldevta’s trident, every chandradarshan  
_Chaandi ki daal par sone ka mor_  
It began to rain hard on the boys making a pyramid  
and then suddenly  
– the crack of the handi
