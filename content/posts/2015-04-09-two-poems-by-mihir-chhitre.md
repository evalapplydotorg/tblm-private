**Varanasi, December 2014**

You unwelcomed me with fog  
on a blinding night  
hurrying into history  
like the feet of your ghaats

As I crawl up  
the rickety slope  
of your refrigerated afternoon  
I am spiral and backward  
in time&#8217;s forsaken bedroom

where chaste Hindi adulterates  
several slips of tongues  
and the languid orality of people  
mulls over suicidal lungs

You rise at sundown  
by the Ganges  
You bathe, you shiver  
urinate, maneuver  
by the Ganges

Your murky bylanes  
meet at the Ganges  
The redness of your paans  
the green of your nimbu chai  
the butts of your secret cigarettes &#8211;  
Your whole existence is a pull-up  
with the dumbbell of a dense dream

In moments, you loop me  
In moments, I loop you back

Your hi and bye are twins  
born out of fog  
and your river-lamps afloat  
man’s finest intricacies

You will outlast me  
Varanasi  
the less I know,  
the better it is.

**Pune, November 2014  
**  
These are elemental fires  
Stoked by the unspoken  
Where the night’s forehead  
Emotes every half a second

At three in the morning  
The winter recedes  
In all directions  
Pune is cold and casual,  
As if falling out of love,  
The room, a silence  
We climb the ramparts of  
With the outstretched  
Ropes of our twenties

Along the hour’s neck,  
Vision seesaws on Old Monk  
By its chin, a dog  
Barks pointlessly  
At the restaurant  
That shut several hours  
And a consciousness ago

The weather throws up  
Like a rookie on cheap whiskey  
Outside, the world contracts  
Into a big false identity  
Across a barricade of smoke  
And a self-taught uncertainty  
A woman rinses her day  
Over a cup of tea  
And along the descend of the balcony  
Stages a cameo  
In this impromptu polygyny 

The spider on the wall  
The half-hearted missed call  
The odd comb, the wafers  
In the hall: The moment&#8217;s  
Makeup overall, how  
I wish, was a sticker  
On the desk of eternity

In this city,  
A glinting test tube  
Of interpersonal coincidences,  
We’re all experimental  
Chords of the experimented
