At an almost-dawn one February, I  
tell you how my parents had  
almost named me after a  
Mahadevi Verma poetry  
collection  
(twice)

निहार(इका)। नीरजा

before the Russians  
invaded the familial  
decision-making, and  
I was christened

Никита| Nikita

&#8220;_Funny how poetry finds  
ways of coming back_&#8220;, I chime.

Like Gulzar and so many  
others, I want to write  
a poem on that precise  
moment when one falls in  
love with their first names for  
the first time as I

imagine the syllables  
forming in your mouth-  
the nasal n rushing into  
the voiceless velar stop,  
both holding on to the long ē  
that shapes your lips into  
the ghost of a smile, ending  
in the hushed softness of  
an alveolar sound:

निकिता

But you only ever address  
me with &#8216;you&#8217; in its various  
shades, using the elusiveness  
of language to your advantage.

&#8216;Names don&#8217;t matter&#8217;, you decide.
