i.  
Almost always, I think of you fondly.  
Like: clouds think of rain;  
Like: words think of sentences;  
Like: women think of orgasms. 

ii.  
But sometimes, dead  
from the shoulders down  
when we aggressively silently—_Chomskily_—  
protest to one another: You’re wrong. You lie.  
We wonder if others notice.  
They must. Our animosity  
obvious as the page of a second-hand Saramago  
where the previous reader  
had given up. A book  
unhandled—the spine unbroken.  
The page is turned down. 

iii.  
That night, right beside the restaurant  
where we had had our Valentine&#8217;s dinner  
one year ago (smoked eel, raw shrimp,  
razor clams, two dozen oysters),  
where I argued with a stubborn bartender,  
we had our first public fight, after dark.

Later on, more places throughout the city  
are bookmarked with our arguments.  
You said, when you felt less apprehensive:  
&#8216;How nice to have left our fights  
littered around the city, like clothes  
discarded by randy lovers.&#8217; 

vi.  
And: ‘You’re attractive  
when you’re fiery, my little Chinese  
magnet, in your royal blue dress,  
a loose white scarf. Also, alas,  
I’m still not cured of book-buying.’
