Over a cup of _chaha_,  
I stumbled over words  
through a conversation  
in a Marathi influenced by the American tongue.

My relatives and friends listened  
their faces falling  
and at that moment  
in that conversation  
the distance between us was much  
further than that of the Atlantic Ocean. 

I’ve picked up languages until now  
as a consequence of picking up my life and placing it in lands where  
English rarely made an appearance.  
Once I landed in a place deep with melanin that looked best in  
the gold of the setting sun.  
Where bodies moved to the rhythm of vudu drums  
that beckoned the spirits to dance with them. 

_Mwen te aprann pale Kreyòl tankou moun yo  
nan peyi kote deyo mon gen mon._

I learnt to speak Creole like those in a country where  
(as the Haitians say to describe the endlessness of their injustices)  
there are mountains beyond mountains.

Another was a place soaked in wine.  
One that reverberated with the sound of heels tapping in time to flamenco.

_Allí yo aprendí a hablar español.  
_  
There I learnt to speak Spanish  
but not like the stunning men and women who made  
it sound so sultry.

I learnt those languages through love  
through dance and in the haze of drunken nights.  
I devoured their dictionaries and remembered  
the minuscule details of conversations held  
on the back of motorcycle taxis  
with my eyes staring at a sky that became less foreign each day. 

My God, I miss those places  
even though my heritage has no trace there.  
We always crave things that are not already ours.

As a child, my parents insisted that I read Marathi fables  
recite the _barakhadi_  
and write it all down.  
They insisted that I speak only in Marathi 

and I?  
I responded in that immigrant kid kind of way.  
I didn’t want to learn Marathi

because its accent fell into my English one at school  
because at that age, language is fluid and does not understand separation  
and does not understand that in a white neighborhood  
my melanin did not mix well  
and neither did the slight slip of my tongue which was  
so accustomed to the spice tin in our kitchen.

So I refused to learn the one thing that was the entire purpose of my parents’ efforts.  
I refused to call my mother  
_aai_. 

Don’t get me wrong. 

_Mala Marathi neet yeta, baraka.  
Mala Punyat ek varsha zalay.  
Aani thoda pan Marathi nai shikle ya velat tar magh kai upyog ithe rahilyacha?  
Thoda far shikliye_

making up for all that lost time  
learning to _feel_ in this language  
wrapping my tongue comfortably around the sounds  
that never make an appearance in English

as it is only through language that we can belong to a place

Over a cup of _chaha_  
I remain a bit soft spoken  
but the words come to me, slowly, determined to be said properly.  
Relatives and friends lean in closer to hear me  
and they hold my hands in theirs and laugh  
celebrating that yes, I am learning  
about what is already mine.
