There are more stars, you  
used to say, than  
all the rice in your aluminium  
tub. On my banana leaf,  
the stars heap and  
watery chutney  
milky-ways around them,  
around clumps of kadle-manoli asteroids.

A lone happala shines chipped in the corner,  
sandige moons orbiting that dwarf planet.  
Remember how you used to string  
them up and offer them to the Bhutas?  
Can these gods see the rings of Saturn?  
Are they counting the revolutions  
that Amma is taking around  
their sanctum?

The east wind carries whiffs  
of supari you left to dry.  
Remember how your teeth were still  
strong enough to crack them?  
_Aane kuli_, you said, those elephant teeth  
could chomp down the Earth.

I crater the center  
of the rice mound, and wait  
for my sniffling mother  
to fill it with saaru.  
I lick-clean the leaf,  
fold its corners in for  
a payasa meteor shower.  
Twirling my hands around the canvas,  
I slurp in the getaway stream  
running down my arm.

A leaf for no one is being prepared–  
a couple of supari nuts in the corner.  
Amma washes my face  
and hands it to me  
to carry to your paddy.  
She tells me to place it there and come back in.

A crow will land,  
pick up a star that you had  
sown and fly away.  
I was told to place it here and come back in  
but I sit  
and I wait.
