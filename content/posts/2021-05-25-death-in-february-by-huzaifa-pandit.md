Once upon a routine death,  
February snow wears a cold night  
in its cataracted eyes, and sets out to meet  
fellow occupants of fresh obituaries in stale newspapers.

Obituaries  
That seek asylum from winter drought  
in lost samovars of salted tea served with warm butter  
at funerals of young militants to thirsty mourners.

Thirsty mourners  
sit across each other in saffron tents  
and lay bets on the average velocity of new guns  
tested in old defense factories sewn on a frenetic metropolis.

They dust off  
a dead militant’s arithmetic  
books lying in sealed schoolbags  
to find formulae for exact square area of elegies  
cast by the hill-shrine on malkhah where pleas  
tied on its latticed windows will be given a state burial.

They never agree on the circumferences of elegies  
and so bargain a lump-sum settlement  
of dinners over smelly kerosene evenings  
and grainy news on BBC Urdu Radio. They hasten to sign  
affidavits that declare on phone-in programs that the sorrow  
of love was only a ruse, we were fated to suffer, and suffer our destiny.
