I like country churches  
While chicken play around in the porch,  
on the steps sit little girls, passing their time picking lice  
And almost always locked are those sacred chambers  
in the holy presence  
of drying bloody red chilies

Indolently swayed across the front, dried palm crosses  
Resident in roof tiles are vagabond squirrels  
The white cat that nestled its kitten in last year’s manger  
is stretching itself towards the yellow star with blue dots  
Nothing. no vaults, no festive lights no pews  
Just a few islands of light float on the cold brick floor

Old tiles require changing; the floor needs sweeping  
at least once a week. On blackout nights,  
just like all other houses, there too a famished candle shines feebly  
No one is giving darshan there. In his father’s house,  
as an unemployed graduate once-in-a-while  
running errands, with sisters at marriageable age— lives Jesus  
Mary, returning from tiring work in the woods, finishes her bath and sets out  
to get embers

Seems like it will rain
