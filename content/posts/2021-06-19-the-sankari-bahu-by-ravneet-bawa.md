is first of all not a person with any  
edges. She has a strong middle but her  
boundaries are mostly fluid. She must  
accommodate. At first, she is expected only  
to be pretty. A grandmother-in-law  
remarks you must rouge your cheeks when  
the ladies of the neighborhood arrive.

Then

and then she must begin to give. Give of her  
sleep a few carefree winks, give of her bath  
a few thoughtful scrubs, give of her tea a few  
shaved sips till water is rich. Give of her gaze

upon self as she begins to look and look and  
never find the girl she was. Give of her will to  
disagree as she is asked, always with politeness  
_to consider_. Give also of choices and opinions  
since there is such a thing as too much choice  
and too many opinions. &#8211;Give of her flesh a little  
to a lot and a lot to a little&#8211; Give she must of her  
time, ah endless time endlessly for must she not  
be a fount so blessed or cursed it is hard to tell.  
Give she must of her time, her time for stupor  
and daydreams, her time for books and politics,  
for sport and culture, for trivia and serendipity.  
Give she must, vacant rooms inside of her.  
Give away darkness and intrigue. Give also  
her stormy womb a moral compass. _Adultery  
needs time she doesn’t have._ And if she  
isn’t spent yet, the Sanskari Bahu  
must give away slices of pulpy  
mangoes to everyone on  
the table as she sits with all the  
pits in. her. plate. Pits have a  
strong middle and edges  
_that yield._
