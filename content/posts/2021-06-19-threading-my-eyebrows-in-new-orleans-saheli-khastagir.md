She plucked and weeded me  
like her private garden.  
Tending to me  
like a page from her Koran,  
or like the kantha my foremothers stitched.  
Nine minutes of complete attention.  
Every stem, every root, every bend.  
She bends on me like a lover, a mother, a devotee.  
_Stretching?_ she says, and plumes me like a bouquet.  
I stretch, she slices, stretch and slice, stretch and slice,  
we are collaborators, co-gardeners and florists, all in one.  
Someone behind me wants bubble tea,  
but really just the tapioca, not the tea, they clarify.  
My lover- mother- gardener gives her permission, yes.  
Yes, tapioca, Yes, bubble tea.  
They divide the chores,  
who will take out the trash, who will sweep the floor.  
If I keep sitting here, I will know  
their bra sizes and sex lives.  
In their rough-cut Hindi and gilded Arabic,  
I recognize them like old neighbours,  
I want to ask them about their mothers’ health,  
and borrow handfuls of lentils and soil.  
When I go to pay, they are unrecognizable again.  
Tongues folded inside a uniform American accent,  
faces set back into customer care smiles,  
one of them asks: _would you like the receipt, ma’am?_
