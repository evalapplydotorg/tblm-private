We wonder what the moth wonders  
when she flutters to the lone,  
warm bulb that stutters  
in the nondescript nook of our house,  
possibly looking for faith the way we do.  
If she does find it fumbling in trepid waters  
that are first bitter and soon engulfing like most  
unfamiliar emotions, we may think she is where  
we are, at the brink of realizing that we are not  
really omnipotent. That is probably where god comes  
from – an enclosed hood with one wavering light bulb,  
a grey-winged moth and its faith in light.
