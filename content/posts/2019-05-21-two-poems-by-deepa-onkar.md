**sky train**

it’s difficult to say what  
we are fleeing: the city is far  
below. on the front seat, people  
read or sleep, their faces suggest  
peace. but something dark curls  
around my shoulders.

blue must be the colour  
of fear. this is my precipice  
of impressions – twirling tree-  
tops, billboards. yesterday  
on the chao praya  
the poised buddhas  
contemplated tourists and yachts.

fear speeded up wears a mask  
of excitement. I watch  
shadows leap into those ripples –  
the lap of water, the sunlight  
infinitesmally close.

stations names attempt to  
soothe: sala daeng, rajadamri  
siam. a girl yawns and stretches.  
someone stares into their phone.  
there is a newspaper, a torn  
shoe. I catch my breath:  
in faraway places the body is home.

**The Quiet**

Rush of traffic.  
A quotidian light hangs still  
by sharp smells of spices; the grind  
sizzle of oil. After months’  
absence, this route stirs  
your bones : old trees and their filtered  
smiles, children cycling  
along, unaware

The city beams  
a secret sign: a crow clambering  
on a soft branch of neem  
arches his neck, wings lifted  
like a letter from a lost alphabet

Crows, climb  
mountains made of wind.  
Leaf-hearts drip from Peepal trees.  
A quiet steals in,  
between the swerves and dips  
of unselfconscious talk

The roads do not end.  
Concrete buildings have mushroomed  
at this spot where a clutch of fruit shops  
once stood. Raucous garbage  
sizes you up for a foriegner.  
Your steps drag on –

The sea has collapsed,  
hissing from twisted lips. You stop  
and listen to the quiet,  
a rush
