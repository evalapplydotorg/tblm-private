When the phone doesn’t stop ringing,  
I excuse myself from the meeting room;  
watch the rain create a rhythm that fails  
to touch me beyond the sound-proof glass

I have collected two seasons  
since the last time you called  
the tremble in your voice seeks familiarity  
_Konnichiwa_ you say in an uneasy whisper  
language has abandoned your fingertips, alienated you,  
your poems now merely mirror the mirage of colors, of shoes and booths,  
gestures you translate, eyes that disclose meanings  
until you slip into the silence of everydayness eating you in the flesh

You dream of burning the distance with lit cigarettes  
while the room stinks of yesterday’s tomato curry  
You fill me with details of love hotels, sex toy stores, dildos you could  
buy to pleasure me  
you crave my presence — it overshadows  
your studio apartment’s bland view,  
you want my lips to wrap your skin  
before you pass into oblivion

You talk of _Ikebana_ and _What the Dickens_ in the same breath,  
the poetry-meets you attend, the _Haibun_ you write,  
The _Sake_ you drink, the girl you wish to talk to but don’t  
You crawl back to your loneliness  
strip naked, cover up in a thick blanket while the world outside  
observes as indifferently as ever. You learn the language, one word at a time,  
dreaming a departure from the land where you have a real conversation  
with the bartender on that lean stool,  
discussing the woes of ordinariness, aimlessly  
hoping that words will find the language  
that will have your voice, after all.
