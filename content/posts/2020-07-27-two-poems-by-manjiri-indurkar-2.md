**Fight or Flight**

The amygdala is a small part of your  
brain that assesses threat, and sets your  
fight or flight response in motion.  
When the threat passes though, the amygdala  
calms down and so does your body.  
However, what do you do when your amygdala  
can’t calm down? When the threat never passes?  
It happens more often than you can  
imagine, that your brain constantly fires stress  
signals, and you respond to them, like a gunshot  
survivor who ducks under the table at the sound  
of a car backfire. Or a rape survivor who shudders  
even at a gentle touch.

The medicines you take can slower your  
responses, but I have got some bad news  
for you, friends. They don’t let you  
take in the love you’ve been seeking  
post that traumatic episode which  
always feels current, you’d think they added  
the ‘post’ as a joke. Some mental health  
humor for those in need of it.

Of the many maladies I suffer from, my favourite  
has to be anxiety. The jokes that come with it  
are precious. This one liner  
for example: _I have an anxiety disorder,  
which means my anxiety orders dis and dat._  
People with anxiety are the real  
humourists, they can appreciate every  
big and small, every dis and dat life hands them.  
The rest of the world is just faking it.

But I digress. Let me get back to the real  
reason why I am here, why anyone of us  
is here, reading this poem, writing it  
as we go. The real reason to write a poem,  
says a friend, is to find love, like it is the  
most profound discovery of the  
post-postmodernist era. And perhaps it is.  
With all the ailments the 21st century has  
given us, love does sit forgotten, somewhere,  
though always thought about. As we inch closer  
to the all-consuming darkness of our depressions,  
love could save us. If only we could recognize  
it, if only our amygdala would stop firing  
stress signals, telling us how every news  
is bad news. How every dis and dat requires  
a fight or a flight.

The road to recovery, says my therapist,  
is filled with traffic signals. You  
have to stop at the red light whenever  
your amygdala takes its flight of fancy.  
If you break the signals, you may  
never make it out alive, the post of your post  
traumatic reality may never get past you.  
As I begin to panic again, she looks at me,  
smiles and cracks a stale but funny joke.  
_How many psychiatrists, she asks, does it take to  
change a light bulb?_  
When I don’t respond, she says,  
_only one, if the light bulb is willing to change._
