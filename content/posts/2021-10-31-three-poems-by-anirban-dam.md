**Turmeric**

My mother is a shade of cinnamon,  
probably less brittle. She wears bangles —  
white, red — replaces them every five years.  
They have traces of gold in them,

and grief. You can see them quiver  
when she kneads, her wrists are hollow flutes  
albeit clogged by dough and domesticity.

Veins, like inlets, coursing through her arm  
converging at some point in her body  
where everything turbulent settles down.

My mother is a pinch of turmeric,  
probably less customary. She wears sarees —  
red, white — buys one every year.  
They are woven from yarns of silk,

and silence. You can hear the village  
in her voice when she speaks.  
Some days, she’s a lullaby  
forgotten midway, some nights  
she’s a drop of water rousing a pot of oil.

Last week, while cleaning the rasoi  
she threw a fit because someone  
had changed the canisters, as if  
something within her had been pried open —  
exposed, unwrapped

then went on to explain  
how light can diminish shelf life,  
how spices without a tight lid can  
bother people with their presence.

**Epidermis**

At the grocery store, we are  
crossing off items on our to-buy list.  
In the organic section, my father  
has now begun his quest for onions.

He takes one at a time, rotates it  
in his hand to check for dents or deformities

I throw a couple in the basket  
to expedite the process but  
he quickly tosses them back in  
the crate, says _this_ one has a soft  
shell and _that_ one has severed roots.

It is both meticulous and somewhat mystical,  
how he prods his thumb on their bodies  
and just knows which ones will last the week.

At the billing counter, my father stands  
somewhat content with his shopping cart.  
Before us, is a lady with her little boy who  
peeps over her shoulder. I smile at him and  
he instantly buries his head in her shoulder.

As she puts her basket on the counter  
my old man scoffs,  
_won&#8217;t even last a week_  
tells me the bell peppers  
are already soft and wrinkled, the onions,  
discoloured; hence, the thumb rule —  
_always check for soft spots_.

The attendant bags the groceries,  
my father hands his debit card,  
and punches in his secret pin  
his quivering hands, calloused and creased,  
skin, hardened in a way that can never be peeled.

**Yarn**

_A thread cannot be broken,  
only torn_. You interrupt, in an attempt  
to correct me, then underline the improbability  
of certain verbs when translated  
into a different language. For instance,  
as a kid you would break a roti or tear a plate.

Likewise, breaking a thread would be like  
tearing a dream, figurative and farfetched,  
only possible in poems. The act of breaking  
something requires muscle or misfortune,  
enough to render it redundant.

Tearing on the other hand, is about strain  
or stress, a scintilla adequate to rip you in shreds.

Across the table, a couple  
is commemorating, a milestone perhaps.  
The waiter, so aptly called, waits  
knowing exactly what wine he’ll order,  
how much they’ll eat,  
how much they’ll _post_,  
and later reminisce about an entrée  
they have discontinued, as if it were  
the origin of their affiliation.

So intriguing it is to witness  
such a ritualistic disentanglement of sorts;  
strands of hair, suits, sweaters,  
fibres —  
neither breaking,  
nor tearing,  
only coming apart at the seams.
