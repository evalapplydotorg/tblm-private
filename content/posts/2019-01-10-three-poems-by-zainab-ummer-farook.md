**Salt**

Mother thunders into the kitchen,  
a banished witch reclaiming her place  
amidst the arcane, and tips  
half a jar of salt into the rice  
like she tipped over the wardrobe  
earlier, her rage untrammelled by grey pills  
or Godrej steel. ‘Choril uppilla,’ she chants,  
her abrupt fury terrifying my cousin,  
whose perfectly-cooked rice has now been  
salted beyond salvation.

It is only years later I understand the ire,  
the ignominy of under-salted rice.  
Second by bland second, hour by insipid hour,  
I stew in my gruel of accumulated griefs,  
its thick, viscous numbness eating away  
at my stomach. The tears are long gone.  
I seek refuge by the sea, yearning for feeling,  
flavour, salt. I could lick it clean off the air at Marina  
or maybe just walk into the waves, the weight  
of unwritten poems lining my pockets — but then

I&#8217;d nest in the sand and never leave,  
my snail-shell fort resolute against the unhurried  
assault of brine. For now, my tongue must weather  
days that taste of nothing, as it hankers for the wispy  
burst of joy from a salted caramel ice-cream.

**Spelling Bee**

I bite  
into the word.

It tastes of hot summer sun  
and thorny wood, staining  
my tongue a deep leafy green

and leaching vowels,  
the consonants left bursting  
like pink popping candy.

They say it’s French, but  
it is as much Kannada as it is  
love’s language

for I buried it, once,  
in a kindergarten playground  
with a half-remembered rhyme

_ondu dina  
peddana hendathi oblu  
laddu maadidlu_

and I saw them  
grow old, flowering  
into memory.

I bite  
into the word, or maybe  
it bites into me.

When a wide-eyed five-year-old  
grabs a prickly arm  
of that great big tree

and bids it yield to her whim,  
he nods assent —  
slowly, lumberingly, but only

if she called him by his name.  
Then, in a sudden blurry quiver  
of brown, the earth shakes

and all that remains  
is papery pink rain  
against solid blue sky

crowning me princess  
of a long-lost dreamland,  
as I spell

b-o-u-g-a-i-n-v-i-l-l-e-a

and dig up  
the roots of all things.

**Miseducation**

Our paths diverged when you told me of Hind&#8217;s rage:  
how she rode into the rotting remains of the battle  
sought the corpse of her uncle&#8217;s killer,  
dug deep into his entrails, yanked out  
the liver and chewed her way through it.

As the story unfolded itself, part by bloody part,  
(shudders, shivers, bile rising in the room)  
I thought: _what a badass, this Hind_.

Then it turned out she joined the Righteous,  
shedding her hunger like snakeskin. I sighed.  
Even liver-eaters receive His mercy, or so you said,  
and in some corner of my head, the story ate dust.  
Some days, however, Hind gallops horseback 

into my dreams, whispers: _the liver?  
Feast on everything you can, love,  
but eat the eyes first_.
