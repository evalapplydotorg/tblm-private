**Library of Olan**

The Library of Olan  
turned upside down  
when bombs of tear gas  
were thrown into its dusty rooms.

The intention was to smoke out  
those who refused to leave  
their obsession of biting into tomes,  
and licking the pages of ancient erotica.

To fill the library with tears,  
interrupt their exile with words,  
dampen the pleasures of marginalia,  
and corrupt the humor of books.

It is now a historical fact,  
that the opposite happened.

Books were now read  
with eyes full of tears.  
Words became mistier,  
sentences danced like waves,  
even scientific manuals  
carried the depth of rivers.

When the news went out,  
people in large numbers  
began migrating to Olan,  
queuing up outside the Library,  
to experience this altered state of emotion.

Inside the Library,  
one could sense at every turn of phrase,  
the entire weight of dialectical philosophy.  
The most basic comedies were laced  
with a tinge of melancholia.

Under the influence of artificial tears  
sentimental lyrics turned fraudulent.  
The longing to cry out of will  
and not force, mirrored  
the tragedy of star-crossed lovers.

In a state of deferred catharsis,  
Aristotle’s plot came undone –  
readers abandoned causal routes  
to wander in bylanes  
of unimportant scenes,  
and look for characters  
without arcs.

In the middle of a story,  
when people looked up  
to exchange glances,  
they silently compared  
the moistness of their hearts,  
and measured the intimate distance  
between their feet.

All the signboards were gone,  
strict instructions suspended &#8211;  
the Library kept sinking  
deeper and deeper  
into Silence.

Today, if you visit  
the Library of Olan,  
you’ll find carpets marked  
with traces of footsteps  
and bookshelves that didn’t rot,  
despite being so damp  
for so many years.

Today, if you turn  
the pages of any book,  
you will find your fingers  
running over printed words,  
but also, over patterns  
of fallen tears.
