summer garbage below  
stench rises like yeast  
to this fourth floor trap  
I strip, circle a dot on a map  
a different heat rises 

the Tao says  
enjoy your food, your family  
your garden, your neighbor &#8211;  
I hear roosters crow  
in another country

I am bound to you, I said  
I am bound to you, you said  
cords of haste waste tangles  
underlying current flowing blithe &#8211;  
forgotten

wave  
boundless ocean  
wave  
boundless ocean  
wave boundless.
