**Calvin-in-exile**

Blue eyes, pupils dilating to the fire creeping  
up the cigarette butt,  
sickly yellow hair, swaying in the harsh blonde  
Beijing wind,

Lines on the face, canyons hewn by rapids  
over the century’s bends,  
Calvin Palmer, while still alive, wandered the _xueyuan&#8217;s_  
corridors like a Dybbuk

trying to follow rules defining space and smoke,  
honored by the natives only in the breach.

While still alive, he often remembered  
the chilly morning he interviewed

the Grateful Dead (on the best day of his life)  
or the day he had covered princess Di’s visit

to his little town or the washed out county  
Viv Richards was to have played.

Mostly, he skipped over his stay  
at Beijing and the visit to the Great Wall

that never happened during his Exile. No plans.  
And no regrets

about making do with just _nihao_ and _zaijian_  
till his end.

**The Black Dog**

Whenever he barked back  
at the German Shepherd or the Pomeranian &#8211; tied to their sleeplessness  
and empty dinner bowls &#8211; my brother,  
would often remark that he was, in reality

a dog trapped inside the human body, though,  
on very drunk nights, he went belly dancing  
like no dog or man ever would/could.  
Fire crackers scared him  
And he hated the cricket ball.

Late one night, returning from a scrounging trip  
to keep the liquor flowing  
at someone else’s bachelor party &#8211; cheap and hosted  
on a borrowed terrace littered with plastic cups  
and KF Strong emptys &#8211; I found him lying  
on a _kutty yanai_, gaze fixed on a canine silhouette  
in the distance. He drank two more

Rounds, on resuming, and cried in earnest  
before throwing down the cup that wouldn&#8217;t mark  
its respect by shattering into pieces,

“Why did that black dog laugh at me?”

&#8212;

P.S: Kutty yanai &#8211; meaning little elephant is slang for the mini van with a open trolley/carriage used for moving goods within short distances

**Mani**

In our colony, all dogs eventually came to be called as Mani.  
The numbered suffixes often forgotten,  
the canine empire, on paper, suffered  
no sunsets to the King’s name.

Three of the Manis  
that led the pack at different points  
in time traced their roots  
to Doti (short for Dog like Tiger), the half blood

Combai, which preferred freedom  
and the neighbor’s chicks to my mother’s vegetarian  
recipes. Doti did occasionally return to his  
original masters, if only to taste  
a morsel of _palaiya sadham_ and _pacha molaga_ or to retrieve  
the rubber ball from Mary teacher’s house (with biblical verses written on its compound wall)

when someone hit _six and out_in the game we played  
in the vacant plot marked by the surveyor’s stones &#8211; cemetery to  
the property boom that was to have visited the colony

a score years back , and later, to Doti himself, the first Mani  
to die of rabies and buried _hush hush_ before we returned from

vacation to hear the story of his mysterious disappearance.
