_Have you ever tried  
to slip out of your skin?_  
Not in the way  
that means sad girls  
and nights of warped mirrors  
shoulders shrugging into themselves—  
this is not a poem about my body.  
Can a poem secede from  
the hands that write it?  
I am welded to myself,  
to my ones and zeros and chipping  
nails and I dream of being elsewhere—  
of stepping out of flesh  
without anything hanging  
off me. A poem I read said bodies  
were made of stardust and most days  
I want to dissolve into nighttime  
like ash or dried leaves in a fist—  
something without fingers, something  
with flight. The boy says he agrees  
with this feminism-sheminism  
until it goes too far, and I want to  
know if he’s ever tried to detach  
from his feet. Sometimes I  
want to put my breasts in a box,  
hips and thighs in the Godrej  
cupboard for some hours  
of nothingness until I’m ready  
for the world to see me as a woman  
again. But things do not  
disappear when you stop  
looking at them and I will  
sit contemplating loudness,  
hemlines and making my voice  
smaller. To exist within flesh  
is to be wriggling constantly—  
to coat myself in red-brick  
dust and other people’s words.  
This is not about my body,  
but look at its audacity. The way  
it paces around the living room,  
and how it never picks up its shoes.
