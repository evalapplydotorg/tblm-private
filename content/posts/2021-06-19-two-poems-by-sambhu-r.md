**Omphalophobia**

“Will you be as gods? Gaze in your _omphalos_”.  
&#8211; _Ulysses_, James Joyce

I have a deep and mouse-eyed fear  
of my navel. An eyeless socket,  
it has something ominous about it.

The tangled scar it cradles  
is a disfigured rosebud that yearns  
to open into perfection in some

exotic garden. When I have run  
a mile or defied gravity, it traps  
the transparent elephants

of my sweat in its abysmal ditch  
covered with the palm fronds  
of belly hair. It is the slipknot

on whose flimsy guarantee my skin  
is stitched together, an asterisk  
to which the organs are a footnote,

and the hub around which my body rotates.  
When I feel the strong migratory pull  
of its half-sunk industrial city

sweltering under the flimsy heat shield  
of polycotton, I hold on tenaciously  
to my extremities dreaming naively

of a cosier future in the centre  
away from dirt and direct exposure  
to life’s varied unpleasantness.

_Kindness_

Kind is the night that divides our room  
into muted light and the monstrous shadows  
of our bodies carried by the bed—  
a pack animal of wood— across the marshes  
of sleep. Kind its moon-masked face  
rinsed by rain, kind its voice that speaks

of impending ruination. On the table lie  
the whorls of a jungle geranium—  
a coronet of torturous thorns  
for humanity’s head—and a half-torn page  
sodden with the effluents of my penmanship,  
a poem murdered before it could come

rampaging into our midst. Poetry runs dry  
like potable water and its last drops stick  
to my conscience like blood stains  
on a vampire’s hungry lips. Ambrosial once,  
we wonder if it has the strength to salvage  
our life of shared illusions

stretched between the gladiatorial arena  
of the mobile screen  
where our commitments collide  
and the TV that suckles us like a she-wolf  
for the kingdom of post-truth.

Our desire must digress from ourselves  
to a simpler love for coexistence  
if we are to jump through the white-hot hoops  
we have hammered our future into. Ancestral plants  
should grow between us and our bed turn

fertile for reviving a dying planet;  
we should feel humbled when green whispers  
hatch a dream of sunrise in our spine  
so fantastical that our blood goes mad  
with the nomadic singing of chlorophyll.
