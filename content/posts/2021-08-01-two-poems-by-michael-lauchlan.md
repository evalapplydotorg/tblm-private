**After Sirens**

triage and questions, a stretcher  
and the littoral cadences of emergency.

Voices, soft and sharp, whisk  
between a young man’s  
lacerations and an old woman

drowsing under a grey bob  
on a cart in a corridor while

her husband shifts weight  
foot to foot beside her.

A nurse draws my blood,  
her phone vibrating—yet another  
procedure, another admit&#8211;

yet another crisis to be managed  
and charted by name and code.

She murmurs as though in some  
stark sleep. A delicate girl

in the negative pressure room  
waits&#8211;we all wait&#8211;

for meds. A slurred boy  
is wheeled in after swallowing  
all the pills he could find.

So many contusions, so many  
aging cells, so many ways

in the well-lit and timeless night  
for a body to come unmoored.
