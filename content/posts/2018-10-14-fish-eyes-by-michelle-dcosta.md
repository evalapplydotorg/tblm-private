_For Mama  
_  
\***

Mom and I talk in the kitchen only. I follow  
her and say, in English, _I miss the Arab  
fisherman from Marina beach terribly_.

_The joy in your eyes when he caught a fish  
every Saturday was special_. She says  
in Konkani. _Dole pole_. She points

at the fish eyes. I search for solidarity.  
_Stale. Should have gone early  
to the market_, she sighs,

her finger still pointing. _Never ever point.  
It is rude_. She had warned. I silence  
my upbringing and tell her about

my friend, in Konkani. Who was dumped  
for being Mangy. Immediately I translate  
it to English. She chops the head,

examines it closely. I have a feeling  
she will not go ahead with cooking it.  
To corroborate my story, I open Facebook

and point at a friend. _Her story_. I say.  
Fiction works any day. I think.  
_Close that thing. Concentrate!_

_Why do you run away?  
What is a girl without cooking?  
When will you even try?_

I can’t tell her the only problem is  
the routine. She has painstakingly learnt  
authentic Mangalorean.

Cutting onions for the curry, Mom tells me  
she cried when I learnt the ABCD. Maybe  
_he_ knew it would work. _Aun tuka mog karta_

_  
_ _he_ confessed one day. The only words  
in Konkani, _he_ learnt to say. I cried  
and got carried away. Maybe _he_ knew

it would work. The way the fisherman knew  
his shrimp. Second Saturday he was away,  
then the next, the next and the next.

I waited, trying to recreate  
the last time I saw him. He was&#8230;  
struggling with a fish in his grip.

He was good, I could tell  
from the size of his catch. Did he let go  
when I wasn’t looking? He must have

moved on to something better.  
Something lighter on the conscience.  
The fish is ready. We sit to eat.

We don’t talk when we eat.  
_Chew your food well.  
Beware. Bones!  
_ 

_The eyes are the tastiest but this.  
Stale._ She says. _Oh, you don’t eat eyes!_  
I put it in my mouth to prove her wrong.

I had given up eating eyes  
at ten. The grey stuff, soft  
and delicious, reminds me of

why I had stopped then.
