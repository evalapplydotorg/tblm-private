I have dug knives in your shoulders  
carefully, and they are still trying to  
go deeper into your warm flesh-  
I am sorry, dear, but I don&#8217;t know if  
I can remove all of them without  
spilling any more blood than what  
already runs off the valleys of your back.  
I have shot at your belly so you  
can never bear any children,  
and bullets are all you can digest now-  
I am sorry, dear, but I don&#8217;t know  
how many bullets I can yank out of  
your stomach without starving you  
of the lead you were forced to feed upon.  
I have carved flesh out of your limbs,  
trying to eat it raw but my stomach refuses  
to process the ache and tenacity of your muscles-  
I am sorry, dear, but I don&#8217;t know  
how many days I can survive without  
devouring your identity and vomiting  
as I revel and say &#8220;You&#8217;re mine, mine, mine.&#8221;
