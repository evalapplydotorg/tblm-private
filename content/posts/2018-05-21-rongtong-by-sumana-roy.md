The houses protrude from the hills like buck teeth.  
But this is no mouth. It’s like Siliguri’s rolled-up sleeve.  
Pink, yellow, anaemic blue – the houses, the molars.  
They’re like leaves, competing for light.  
I notice their stillness,  
how they never shiver from the cold.  
The windows rattle, I know, though I can’t hear them now,  
but the wind could be mistaken for insects.  
They eat similarly, perhaps.  
I haven’t seen them copulating though –  
neither insects, nor the winds.  
Rongtong – it could be the name of an insect,  
one trapped in a jar, treating the glass as food.  
It could be the name of the wind too,  
the rhythm of advance and retreat. Rong Tong.

Hill Cart Road behaves like a priest, waiting for converts.  
I’ve stopped. The car is getting back its breath.  
The tyres are losing heat, regaining innocence.  
On the left are houses abandoned by children’s drawing books –  
triangles on squares, the eaves half-broken,  
as if erased by an absent-minded child.  
All houses are related, I know.  
Like men, like their hair and eyes,  
and how they shiver.  
The toy train passes by, its smoke a blob,  
like a soft-boiled egg that’s stuck to its chimney.  
It is serious about its slowness,  
as if that was its gift, like the sea is on a beach.  
I see it move away, like a language teacher in school,  
moving to another classroom.  
All that remains is the pram-like gesture of its wheels,  
the houses soaking that sound, muttering in echo.  
The road and the rail lines merge far away,  
like the buttocks of a wide-hipped woman  
that meet only in our mind.
