**The Pianist**

Pruning my words as tranquil targets,  
three girls aged ten trebled my response  
to our music instructor’s initial inquiry:  
“the flute felt like floating on a cloud.”

Flight dispersed further away with each word  
uttered so I tucked infatuation to soar safely  
alongside daymares kept under lock and key,  
threaded through the bodies battered by a butterfly  
shaped hole-puncher. I bit my lip so often, skin  
perpetually hung as an apology for my existence.

We could never afford to tune the piano. I was  
blamed for fracturing F# though my mother  
never apologized for splitting open my head.  
Sealed sketches scattered mother’s staccato  
in an amaranthine notebook — confiscated.  
I’d lounge shamelessly like a cat in the sun  
in stained threads to lap up my mother’s  
practicing notes: first, the obligatory hymnals  
for Sunday school. Years progressed, my

disobedient body elongated, and barren items  
chiseled to a hoarder’s delight; I would fold  
myself beneath a quilting frame or underneath  
nanny’s antique table, places I could safely  
shed. Then, she basted banal corporate classics.  
As a teen, I’d pause Evanescence CDs on rotation  
to listen — no longer disposing ridicule to return  
to the living room — still hoping for an encore.

She’d intermittently indulge _Stairway to Heaven_  
before concluding with _Beth_, her anger darted  
like injured insults or diffused jabs over keys,  
transforming a ballad into a livid manifesto.

Mother dearest never played without sheet music.  
Instead, she sneered any hesitation of mine as  
manipulated motifs while performing memorized scores.  
My growing pains of imperfection were flossed  
until, obedient daughter, I abandoned my passion  
to ensure she remained best in house.

**Before the Fairness Pitcher Shattered**

I condense my home country to an  
abbreviation, as if 3 letters are non-  
matching socks of the same hue

folded haphazardly within a pair  
of shoes hidden inside the lining  
of a tattered suitcase. The soft walls

of a tea cup are all I have faith to call  
home. I pickle disappointment as pages  
perish; a flicked ant becomes a comma.

My body is a crumpled canvas of  
forgotten calligraphy; it folds neatly  
as it’s steeped with discarded scars

and play-pretend pigmentation.  
Friends I cannot hug nurture my grief.  
My hands ache in reticent punctures.

I ignite the kettle. Who births a language?
