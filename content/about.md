ABOUT
The Bombay Literary Magazine is home to some of the best contemporary fiction and poetry. We are interested in the Word and all its possibilities. We are known to take chances and push towards new aesthetics, new sensibilities, and new voices. In our archives spanning the last 8 years, you will find the work of established writers and prize winners alongside important emerging voices.

In order to emphasize the personal, intimate relationship with language, our magazine is deliberately minimal. Black and white. Ink and milk. In a world of hyperlinks and GIFS, we believe this cuts out the clutter. The text is not a pretext.
