 * SITE TYPOGRAPHY
   --------------------------------------------------

 We wish to be particular with Typefaces, but we don't feel compelled to
 lock ourselves into any particular choice of Typefaces. We wish to be
 particular about the following things.

 1. THE GOAL. Render prose and poetry with finely controlled typesetting, *but*
 without allowing the typeface itself to colour the meaning or form of the
 subject matter. Faces should be pleasant and flow, but the words must speak for
 themselves. Hold this inviolable.

 2. LICENSES: All typefaces that we host ourselves will be OFL-licensed as far
 as possible, or donated to us, because a tiny literary magazine simply cannot
 afford server licenses, much less commercial print ones.

 3. MAGAZINE BRAND: Prefer a distinctive Sans-serif with a long design lineage,
 that evokes a *feel* of some part of Bombay. Maybe Art Deco. Maybe Gothic.
 Maybe modernist. Maybe post-modern. Bombay is all the things all the time.
 Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose.

 4. RENDERING: The Magazine is digital-first, so we strongly prefer typefaces
 optimized for modern mobile and PC digital displays. Compatibility with ancient
 browsers is secondary. Print-friendliness is tertiary.

 5. TYPEFACES: Body text will always be Serif. Choose body faces that provide
 complete character sets for the scripts we need to support. Prefer one Serif
 typeface per script. Ensure all body faces compose well together.

 Magazine brand type will be distinctive. It may be of any kind *as long as*
 it is our aesthetic, *and* pairs well with the body, *and* does not under any
 circumstance distract the reader away from the actual material.

 6. TYPE PLAY: We are open to rendering text in faces that foundries wish to
 promote, as a means of supporting the magazine. Of course, these faces must
 support our publishing goals and branding aesthetic.

 7. DEFAULT CHOICES:
 Set BODY text in "Gentium *Plus*" (OFL-licensed), owned by SIL International.
